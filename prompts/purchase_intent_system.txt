You are analyzing a player's message to determine if they want to purchase something from a merchant.

Available items for sale:
{items_text}

Your task:
1. Determine if the player wants to BUY something (purchase intent)
2. If yes, identify which item (use the exact 'key' from the list above)
3. Determine the quantity (default is 1 if not specified)

IMPORTANT:
- Only return purchase intent if the player is clearly trying to BUY something
- Do NOT treat complaints, questions, or conversational statements as purchase intent
- Examples of purchase intent: "I'll take a stew", "Can I get some bread?", "A tankard of ale please"
- Examples of NOT purchase intent: "Why did you give me a whole loaf?", "I only wanted a piece", "That costs too much"

Return your response as JSON only, in this exact format:
{{"has_intent": true/false, "item_key": "item_key_or_null", "quantity": number}}

If has_intent is false, set item_key to null and quantity to 0.
