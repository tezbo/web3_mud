[PAUSE:1]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  • HUMAN
    The most common folk. Versatile, adaptable, unbound by ancient pacts.
    You remember countless lives as farmer, merchant, warrior, scholar.
    In you flows the blood of endless possibility.

  • ELF
    Graceful and long-lived, touched by the magic of the old world.
    You recall lifetimes spent in ancient forests, under starlit skies.
    The arcane whispers to you, and you move with otherworldly elegance.

  • DWARF
    Sturdy and unyielding, forged in the depths of the earth.
    Memories of stone halls and ringing hammers fill your mind.
    You carry the resilience of mountains and the craft of ages.

  • HALFLING
    Small but determined, blessed with luck and resourcefulness.
    You remember cozy hearths, warm meals, and finding joy in simple things.
    Fortune smiles upon you, and opportunity finds you where others see none.

  • FAE-TOUCHED
    Touched by the magic of the fae realm, reality bends around you.
    Fragments of the Otherworld linger in your soul.
    You are not entirely of this realm, and the world knows it.

  • OUTLANDER
    From lands unknown, a mystery even to yourself.
    Your origins are strange, your past a puzzle.
    You carry the weight of distant places and forgotten truths.

[PAUSE:1.5]
"What tale will you bring with you? What weight will you carry?"

[PAUSE:2]
"Choose the story that defines you:"

[PAUSE:1]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  • SCARRED_PAST
    You carry the weight of loss and hardship.
    Your past has left marks, but also made you stronger.
    Pain has shaped you, but it does not define you.

  • FORGOTTEN_LINEAGE
    You know little of your true heritage.
    There are gaps in your memory, mysteries in your blood.
    Something important was lost, and you sense there is more to your story.

  • BROKEN_OATH
    You once made a promise you could not keep.
    The weight of that failure drives you forward.
    Redemption calls to you, or perhaps acceptance.

  • HOPEFUL_SPARK
    Despite the darkness in the world, you carry a light within.
    You believe in better days ahead.
    Hope is your strength, and you refuse to let it die.

  • QUIET_MYSTERY
    You prefer to keep your past to yourself.
    There are things you know that others do not.
    Secrets are your currency, and silence your shield.

  • CUSTOM
    Your story is your own to tell.
    Write it in your own words.
