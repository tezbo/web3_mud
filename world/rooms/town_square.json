  "description": "You stand in the heart of Hollowvale, a cozy frontier square where cracked cobblestones circle an old fountain. The water still flows, though the basin is weathered with age. A notice board stands to one side, its parchment fluttering in the breeze. To the north, a rocky path leads up toward the watchtower that overlooks the valley. The square feels familiar and safe, yet there's a sense that this place has seen many stories.",
