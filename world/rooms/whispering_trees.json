  "description": "You've entered a dense grove where the trees seem to lean in, their branches creating a canopy that filters the light. The air is still, and there's a sense that you're not entirely alone. The trees themselves seem to hold conversations in rustling leaves, though you can't quite make out the words. This place feels alive in a way that goes beyond the ordinary, as if the forest has its own voice, its own awareness. A good place to listen, if you know how.",
