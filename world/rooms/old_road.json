  "description": "An old, rutted road runs eastward out of Hollowvale, its surface worn by countless travelers and the passage of time. This road leads toward lands you've only heard of in stories—kingdoms, cities, and adventures that lie beyond the horizon. For now, it feels like the edge of your known world, a threshold between the familiar and the vast unknown. The road promises journeys yet to come, stories yet to be written.",
