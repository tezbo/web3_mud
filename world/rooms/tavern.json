  "description": "The Rusty Tankard welcomes you with warmth and noise. The air is thick with the smell of stew and wood smoke. Rough-hewn tables fill the space, and adventurers and locals share stories over tankards of ale. A fire crackles in the hearth, casting dancing shadows on the walls. This is the kind of place where news travels and friendships are forged.",
