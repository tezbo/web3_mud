  "description": "The smithy is a low building of stone and timber, its walls hung with tools and half-finished work. The forge glows with banked embers, and the air carries the scent of coal and hot metal. Anvils stand ready, and the walls are lined with hammers, tongs, and other implements of the trade. This is where the village's metalwork is born, practical and honest.",
