# Aethermoor: World Lore Primer
## *Where Three Realms Meet*

## The Sundering (500 Years Ago)

In the Age of Wonders, magic flowed freely through reality like rivers of light. The great **Singers' Council** ruled from the Crystal Spire, manipulating the threads of existence with exquisite precision. They grew arrogant.

On the night of the Crimson Moon, the Council attempted the Forbidden Singing—to rewrite the threads of time itself. The backlash shattered reality.

**What happened**:
- The world split into three distinct realms, separated by impassable barriers
- Magic became unstable and dangerous
- Millions died instantly as the threads unraveled
- Ancient cities sank, mountains rose, seas boiled
- The **Shadowfen** formed as a scar between realms

**The aftermath**:
- Most Singers died or went mad from thread-sickness
- Knowledge was lost, libraries burned
- Kingdoms fragmented into warring territories
- Magic users became feared, hunted, or revered depending on culture

## The Three Realms

### The Sunward Kingdoms (Western)
*"Steel and Stone, Oath and Crown"*

**Geography**:
- Rolling hills, ancient forests, coastal cities
- Stone architecture—castles, fortified towns, cobblestone roads
- Seasons are pronounced (harsh winters, warm summers)

**Culture**:
- Feudal system: kings, lords, knights
- Magic is **feared** and **restricted**—"thread-sickness" is common
- Values: Honor, duty, pragmatism, tradition
- Religion: The Old Faith (nature worship), The Seven Virtues (chivalric code)

**Current State**:
- Fragmented into rival kingdoms after the Sundering
- Slowly reunifying under the **Iron Alliance**
- Expansionist—seeking ancient artifacts and lost knowledge
- Tension with Twilight over magical philosophy

**Notable Locations**:
- **Thornhaven** (capital of largest kingdom)
- **The Grey Marches** (border region, constant skirmishes)
- **Aldric's Rest** (ruined city, pre-Sundering)

**Naming Conventions**: Anglo/Celtic—Aldric, Mara, Grimble, Elara, Cedric

---

### The Twilight Dominion (Eastern)
*"Harmony in Threads, Balance in All"*

**Geography**:
- Island archipelago, floating markets, jade cliffs
- Architecture: Curved roofs, paper screens, hanging gardens
- Eternal twilight (sun never fully rises or sets—lingering effect of Sundering)

**Culture**:
- Clan-based society with strict honor codes
- Magic is **embraced** and **refined**—Singers are revered masters
- Values: Discipline, mastery, harmony, patience
- Philosophy: The Way of Threads (magic as art and meditation)

**Current State**:
- Stable but isolated—focuses inward on perfection
- Protective of magical knowledge (hoards pre-Sundering texts)
- Views Sunward kingdoms as barbaric and reckless
- Slowly opening trade through the Shadowfen

**Notable Locations**:
- **The Jade Towers** (council of master Singers)
- **The Obsidian House** (exclusive gambling den, run by Jade Syndicate)
- **The Floating Market** (neutral trade zone)

**Naming Conventions**: East Asian blend—Jin-Soo, Mei-Lin, Akira, Takeshi, Yuki

---

### The Shadowfen (Neutral Territory)
*"No Crown, No Clan—Only Coin"*

**Geography**:
- Swamplands, mist-shrouded ruins, makeshift cities built on stilts
- The Scar—a visible tear in reality where threads still unravel
- Dangerous wildlife mutated by unstable magic

**Culture**:
- **No dominant culture**—refugees and exiles from both realms
- Pragmatic, survival-focused, morally grey
- Values: Adaptability, resourcefulness, secrecy
- Home to smugglers, outlaws, mercenaries, and those who don't fit elsewhere

**Current State**:
- Growing rapidly as people flee conflicts in both realms
- Neutral ground for trade between Sunward and Twilight
- Lawless but functional—governed by powerful guilds
- Source of rare materials from the Scar (dangerous to harvest)

**Notable Locations**:
- **Greymarket** (largest city, built on ruins)
- **The Scar** (dangerous zone where reality fractures)
- **The Mire** (swamp settlements)

**Naming Conventions**: Mixed/adaptive—Vex, Zara, Kesh, Grimm, Sable

## Magic: The Singing

### How It Works

Magic is the manipulation of reality's fundamental **threads**. Skilled practitioners (Singers) can see these threads and reshape them.

**The Five Threads**:
1. **Flame** (fire, light, energy)
2. **Water** (healing, weather, emotions)
3. **Earth** (strength, crafting, stability)
4. **Air** (movement, perception, communication)
5. **Spirit** (mind, soul, time—forbidden since Sundering)

### The Cost

Singing isn't free:
- **Mental strain**: Causes headaches, exhaustion, nosebleeds
- **Thread-sickness**: Singing too much causes madness
- **Physical toll**: Burns calories, ages the body slightly
- **Instability**: Post-Sundering, threads can snap unpredictably

### Cultural Approaches

**Sunward**: 
- Rare practitioners called "Thread-touched"
- Often self-taught or trained in secret
- High risk of thread-sickness due to lack of proper training
- Feared and sometimes executed as witches

**Twilight**:
- Formal academies and master-apprentice system
- Decades of training to master even one thread type
- Ritual meditation to prevent thread-sickness
- Singers are honored as artists and scholars

**Shadowfen**:
- Pragmatic, dangerous magic
- Scavengers harvest thread-infused materials from the Scar
- "Scar-touched" magic is powerful but unstable
- No formal training—learn by doing or die trying

---

## Current Conflicts

### The Artifact Rush
Sunward kingdoms are excavating pre-Sundering ruins, seeking:
- Weapons woven with stable threads (lost technique)
- Knowledge from the old Singers' Council
- Power to reunify and expand

Twilight views this as **grave robbing** and **dangerous**—the very artifacts that caused the Sundering.

### The Thread War (Philosophical)
**Sunward belief**: Magic is inherently dangerous and should be controlled/eliminated  
**Twilight belief**: Magic is natural and beautiful when mastered with discipline

Both sides have valid points (Sundering proved magic can be catastrophic).

### The Shadowfen Problem
- Growing population of refugees strains resources
- Neither realm claims responsibility
- Powerful guilds in Shadowfen gaining influence
- The Scar is expanding slowly—reality continues to fray

## Races & Peoples

### Humans
Three distinct cultures (Sunward, Twilight, Fen Folk) but all human.

### Elves (Aelthari)
- **Not** immortal or aloof—they're refugees
- Survived the Sundering in hidden groves
- Live ~300 years but age normally
- Remember the world before
- Fewer than 10,000 remain
- Scattered across all three realms
- Some seek to undo the Sundering, others accept the new world

### Stoneblooded (Optional)
- Not true dwarves—humans altered by earth thread exposure
- Shorter, stockier, incredibly dense bones
- Natural affinity for earth thread singing
- Master crafters of thread-infused items
- Live in mountain holds at realm borders

### Fae-touched (Optional)
- Humans born with innate thread-sight (can see threads but not sing)
- Rare (~1 in 10,000 births)
- Valued as advisors, scouts, artifact hunters
- Often go mad from seeing threads constantly

## Religion & Belief

### The Old Faith (Sunward)
- Nature worship, seasonal rituals
- Believes the Sundering was divine punishment for hubris
- Druids serve as healers and advisors
- No organized church—local wise folk

### The Seven Virtues (Sunward)
- Knightly code: Honor, Courage, Justice, Mercy, Truth, Loyalty, Sacrifice
- Not a religion but shapes culture
- Knights swear oaths on the seven

### The Way of Threads (Twilight)
- Philosophy/religion blend
- Threads are sacred manifestations of universal harmony
- Proper singing is meditation and worship
- Masters achieve enlightenment through perfect balance

### The Forgotten Litany (Shadowfen)
- Scraps of pre-Sundering beliefs
- Superstitions about the Scar
- "The threads remember"—belief that reality itself holds grudges
