- **Greymarket ↔ Floating Market**: 4-6 days via Shadowfen routes
- **Thornhaven ↔ Port Sentinel**: 2 days along coastal road
- **Within Shadowfen**: 1-3 days (terrain difficult)

### Waystones (Fast Travel)
Ancient pre-Sundering teleportation network. Only some locations have them:
- ✓ Greymarket (Central Hub)
- ✓ Thornhaven (Sunward)
- ✓ The Jade Towers (Twilight)
- ✗ Dungeons and ruins (never have waystones)
- ✗ Secret locations

**Limitation**: Players must first discover and activate each waystone through exploration.

### Travel Descriptions
Transition areas between locations have 3-5 rooms with environmental storytelling:
- Grey Marches: Watchtowers, patrols, tension
- Shadowfen Routes: Mist, swamp dangers, smugglers
- Coastal Roads: Sea views, merchants, weather

### Phase 2: First Realm Content
- Thornhaven (Sunward) - 15 rooms
- Floating Market (Twilight) - 8 rooms
- **Goal**: Players can experience all 3 realms

### Phase 3: Dungeons
- Aldric's Rest (Sunward) - 10 rooms
- The Forgotten Archive (Shadowfen) - 12 rooms
- **Goal**: PvE exploration content

### Phase 4: Special Locations
- The Obsidian House (web3)
- The Jade Towers (high-level content)

## Total Room Count

| Realm | Locations | Total Rooms |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Sunward Kingdoms | 5 | 43 |
| Shadowfen | 5 | 55 |
| Twilight Dominion | 5 | 38 |
| **TOTAL** | **15** | **136** |

**Current**: 11 rooms (Greymarket)  
**Target**: 136 rooms across 3 realms

---

## Design Notes

1. **Greymarket as Starting Zone**: Neutral Shadowfen city allows players to choose which realm to explore first

2. **Balanced Content**: Each realm has ~40-55 rooms, roughly equal

3. **Vertical Exploration**: Dungeons (Aldric's Rest, Forgotten Archive) provide dungeon-crawling

4. **Cultural Distinction**: Each realm's locations reinforce cultural identity (stone, jade, mist)

5. **Fast Travel Balance**: Waystones only at major hubs, not dungeons - encourages exploration

6. **Expansion Ready**: Structure supports adding more locations later
