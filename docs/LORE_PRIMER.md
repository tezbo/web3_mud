1. Introduction: The World of Aethermoor

Aethermoor is a realm shaped by ancient forces, scarred by catastrophe, and held together by the living songs of magic known as Threadsinging.
It sits at the crossroads of three great cultural spheres:
	•	the grounded Sunward Kingdoms,
	•	the refined Twilight Dominion,
	•	and the mist-wreathed Shadowfen,

…each changed by the event known as The Sundering, which fractured the world’s geography and magic five centuries ago.

Aethermoor is a world of:
	•	living ambience (weather, cycles, NPC chatter)
	•	personal stories
	•	local politics and regional tensions
	•	ritual magic and dangerous secrets
	•	towns and wilderness shaped by climate, craft and culture

This primer ensures all parts of the game — rooms, NPCs, items, quests, dialogue — align consistently.

⸻

2. The Three Realms

Aethermoor’s civilisations fall into three major cultural realms.
These are not absolute borders — people migrate, trade and intermix — but they define aesthetic, cultural and magical norms.

⸻

2.1 SUNWARD KINGDOMS

Culture: Anglo-Celtic / Guild-driven / Practical
Materials: Stone, timber, iron, sun-forged steel
Flavour: Hearthfires, keeps, cobbled roads, mead halls
Cities feel like: A hybrid of Discworld’s Ankh-Morpork and medieval England/Scotland

Personality & Values

Sunward folk value:
	•	pragmatism over philosophy
	•	craft skill and guild reputation
	•	stories of heroism and failure
	•	directness in speech

They have a dry humour and tend to be blunt but warm-hearted.

Landscape

Rolling hills, granite cliffs, oak forests, wind-beaten coasts.
Weather is mild but moody — storms roll in quickly, and locals read the clouds like prophets.

Architecture

Stone walls, slate roofs, timber beams, iron fittings.
Streets are lively, messy, and full of chatter.

Names

Aldric, Mara, Brannoc, Elira, Cedric, Alwen, Grimble, Tress.

⸻

2.2 TWILIGHT DOMINION

Culture: East Asian–inspired blend (Korean/Chinese/Japanese tones)
Materials: Jade-steel, lacquered wood, silk, paper lanterns
Flavour: Courtyards, shrines, academies, quiet mastery
Cities feel like: Genshin-Impact-meets-Han dynasty with Studio Ghibli realism

Personality & Values

Twilight culture values:
	•	refinement and etiquette
	•	self-discipline
	•	scholarship and mastery
	•	harmony between craft, nature and spirit

Conversation tends toward poetic understatement.

Landscape

Steep misty mountains, terraced fields, crystalline lakes, bamboo groves, moonlit paths.

Architecture

Lacquered pillars, jade inlay, tiled roofs with sweeping curves, paper screens, tea gardens.

Names

Mei-Lin, Akira, Jin-Soo, Hanae, Renzo, Yui-Shen.

⸻

2.3 SHADOWFEN

Culture: Fringe / Opportunistic / Survival-driven
Materials: Mire-iron, bogwood, scavenged relics
Flavour: Fog, decay, improvisation, wary alliances
Cities feel like: Witcher’s Velen + Dishonored’s Dunwall + Black Marsh (TES)

Personality & Values

Shadowfen folk value:
	•	adaptability
	•	secrets
	•	bargains (written or unwritten)
	•	looking after their own

Humour is sharp, dry, ironic — a survival mechanism.

Landscape

Marshes, swamp forests, fungal groves, rust-red wetlands.
Weather is heavy: mists, drizzles, thick humidity.

Architecture

Stilt houses, rope bridges, lantern-lit walkways, scavenged metal sheets, warped timber structures.

Names

Vex, Zara, Kesh, Orlo, Sura, Venn, Mira-Fen.

3. The Sundering

Five centuries ago, a catastrophic magical rupture reshaped Aethermoor.

What actually happened?

The Threads of Creation — the five primal forces woven through reality — snapped violently in several places.
The cause is debated:
	•	a failed ritual
	•	a cosmic alignment
	•	hubris of ancient archmages
	•	or a creature “not meant for this world”

Consequences
	•	Landmasses ruptured and realigned.
	•	Weather became unpredictable and region-specific.
	•	Magic became volatile but also accessible, birthing Threadsingers.
	•	Some places were caught mid-transformation and remain dangerous “Sundered zones.”
	•	Factions formed around controlling or healing the wounded Threads.

This event shapes nearly all modern tensions.

⸻

4. Magic: THREADSINGING

Magic in Aethermoor is the art of manipulating the Threads of Creation, each tied to a primal element.

The Five Threads
	1.	Flame – heat, passion, illumination
	2.	Water – memory, change, reflection
	3.	Earth – growth, stability, resolve
	4.	Air – motion, intuition, foresight
	5.	Spirit – life-force, emotion, empathy, the unseen

Who can Threadsinge?

Not all — but many.
Threadsinging is not genetic; it emerges from affinity, trauma, training, or sheer accident.

How magic behaves
	•	Small effects are intuitive, emotional.
	•	Larger effects require ritual, focus, or tools.
	•	Magic is not uniform: each realm emphasises different Threads.
	•	Overuse frays the singer’s own internal Threads.

Visual aesthetics

Magic appears as:
	•	shimmering filaments
	•	vibrating air
	•	patterns of colour
	•	harmonic tones
	•	ripples in the environment

AI agents should weave these sensory cues into descriptions and NPC behaviour.

5. Technology & Materials

Aethermoor is a late medieval / early renaissance tech world, with:
	•	guild-crafted tools
	•	enchanted and mundane weapons
	•	regional material specialities
	•	no firearms, electricity, plastic, or modern tech

Signature Materials
	•	Sun-forged steel – brightest, strongest; Sunward craft
	•	Jade-steel – elegant hybrid metal; Twilight specialty
	•	Mire-iron – dark, pitted, but magically resistant; Shadowfen
	•	Ironwood – nearly unbreakable timber
	•	Silksteel – rare textile reinforced with Spirit Thread energy

⸻

6. Factions & Organisations (Starter Set)

These can be expanded later, but define core tensions.

Sunward
	•	The Hearthbound Guilds – trade, craft, politics
	•	Wardens of the Coast – defence and lighthouse-mages

Twilight
	•	The Jade Archives – scholars of Threads and history
	•	Lantern Court – spirit mediators and diplomats

Shadowfen
	•	The Mireclad – protectors of swamp lands and mutated flora
	•	The Red Lantern Syndicate – black market, salvage, whispered power

Cross-Realm
	•	The Order of the Weavebound – healers of Sundered rifts
	•	The Free Company of Threadbreakers – mercenary thread-hunters

⸻

7. Monsters & Creatures

Aethermoor creatures reflect their realm’s nature.

Sunward
	•	Stonebacks (armoured boars)
	•	Sunwings (eagle-like raptors)

Twilight
	•	Jade Serpents
	•	Lantern Foxes (glowing, spirit-touched)

Shadowfen
	•	Bog Crawlers
	•	Thread-Warps (mutants from Sundered zones)

AI agents should vary behaviour, flavour and drops accordingly.

⸻

8. Cultural Aesthetics & Writing Guidelines

General Guidelines
	•	Use all five senses: taste, smell, texture, sound, temperature.
	•	Show rather than tell — let ambience reveal mood.
	•	Avoid generic fantasy clichés unless deliberately humorous.

Sunward Style

Warm, earthy, blunt, hearty.
Rooms evoke stone, wood, firelight, bustling crowds.

Twilight Style

Precise, quiet, elegant.
Rooms evoke moonlight, lacquer, jade, gardens, subtle magic.

Shadowfen Style

Gritty, humid, ironic, razor-edged.
Rooms evoke fog, mildew, rope bridges, rust, survival tension.

⸻

9. Design Hooks for Rooms, NPCs and Quests

Rooms

Every room should have:
	•	A primary environmental detail
	•	A cultural detail (architecture, craft)
	•	A thread of ambience (sound, weather, smell)
	•	A point of interaction (NPC, object, exit, clue)

NPCs

Each NPC must have:
	•	A goal
	•	A fear
	•	A secret
	•	A personality consistent with their realm
	•	An opinion about: The Sundering, the Threads, their neighbours

Quests

Quests should reflect:
	•	regional tensions
	•	fragments of old lore
	•	moral ambiguity
	•	multiple possible solutions
	•	unpredictable AI-enhanced NPC reactions

⸻

10. Aethermoor’s Tone

Aethermoor’s tone is:
	•	fantastical
	•	immersive
	•	slightly whimsical
	•	slightly gritty
	•	rich in sensory detail
	•	inspired by Discworld’s humour but grounded in its own mythology

It should feel alive, not static.

Weather shifts, NPCs wander, time passes, ambience speaks.

11. Final Notes for AI Agents

When generating content:
	•	Always cross-check realm, culture, and magical context
	•	Avoid contradictions with the Sundering or Threadsinging
	•	Use appropriate materials and naming conventions
	•	Reference weather, time, and ambience where relevant
	•	Keep the tone coherent with Aethermoor’s unique identity
	•	When unsure, ask for clarification before proceeding
