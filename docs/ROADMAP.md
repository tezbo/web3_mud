# Aethermoor MUD – Development Roadmap

> Note: This is a design and planning document. It describes the intended feature set and milestones for Aethermoor; not all features listed here are implemented yet.

> The first major playable area is the town of **Hollowvale**, a Sunward-border settlement used as the initial prototype region.

## Vision Statement
A text-based multiplayer MUD with AI-powered NPCs, a living world, and classic MUD gameplay. Target: **1000 concurrent players** with smooth, real-time interactions.

---

## Immersion-First Roadmap (Summary)

Aethermoor is not just a command parser – it must feel like living inside a fantasy novel. To make that real, we follow an immersion-first roadmap **alongside** the feature roadmap.

Full details live in `docs/IMMERSION_ROADMAP.md`. This section summarises the immersion phases so they can be aligned with technical milestones.

### Phase I – Make the World Breathe

**Goal:** Transform static rooms into living places.

- Add sensory layers to rooms (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste).  
- Make descriptions responsive to **time of day** and **weather**.  
- Upgrade items so they have micro-stories, detailed examination text and visible wear/age.

Linked implementation areas:
- `Room` model (`get_full_description()`, sensory fields).  
- Room JSON templates (`world/rooms/*.json`).  
- Item model and commands (`look`, `examine closely`).

### Phase II – Make Combat Memorable

**Goal:** Turn combat from repeated dice rolls into memorable war stories.

- Introduce stamina, stances (aggressive/defensive/tactical) and status effects.  
- Give enemies personalities, signature moves and combat dialogue.  
- Use AI as a **combat narrator** to add flavour text without changing core mechanics.

Linked implementation areas:
- `game/systems/combat.py` (CombatSystem).  
- Enemy/NPC definitions (`npc.py`, future JSON templates).  
- Combat messaging and log output.

### Phase III – Make NPCs Unforgettable

**Goal:** NPCs should feel like characters, not response terminals.

- Give NPCs **goals, moods and agendas**, not just static lines.  
- Let quests **emerge from NPC situations** instead of only from explicit quest givers.  
- Allow NPCs to initiate conversations when something matters to them.

Linked implementation areas:
- NPC state and behaviour (`npc.py`, `game/systems/npc_system.py`).  
- Quest engine (dynamic triggers, emergent questlines).  
- AI prompts that include NPC goals, mood and recent events.

### Phase IV – Make the World Reactive

**Goal:** Player actions should echo through the world.

- Track major player actions in a **ConsequenceLog**.  
- Let NPCs gossip and adjust relationships based on what they hear.  
- Change room descriptions, prices and quest options in response to player reputation.

Linked implementation areas:
- World/quest state (`game/state.py`, persistence layer).  
- NPC relationship mapping and gossip system.  
- Room description variants keyed off world state.

### Phase V – The AI Revolution

**Goal:** Deliver something no classic MUD has had: NPCs that truly surprise you.

- Let NPCs act proactively when their goals or mood demand it.  
- Allow overheard NPC-to-NPC conversations generated by AI.  
- Use AI for dynamic but **cached** content: ambient lines, item lore, minor NPCs.

Linked implementation areas:
- `ai_client.py` and NPC AI integration.  
- Redis-backed caching for AI-generated content.  
- NPC update loops and initiative logic.

> **Note:** The feature phases below (combat, progression, quests, architecture) should be implemented in ways that support this immersion roadmap. For concrete examples and sample code, see `docs/IMMERSION_ROADMAP.md`.

## Current Status (November 2024)

### ✅ Completed Core Systems
- **World & Movement**: 11 rooms, directional movement, room descriptions with time/weather

- [ ] Command aliases (`k` for `kill`, `i` for `inventory`, etc.)
- [ ] Better error messages ("You can't go that way" → "The door is locked")
- [ ] Item stacking in inventory (show "3x apple" instead of listing 3 times)
- [ ] Quest progress indicators in room descriptions
- [ ] NPC shop UI improvements

- [ ] Auto-complete for commands/NPC names

---

## Technical Debt Items

- [ ] `game_engine.py` is 10,000+ lines – needs refactoring
- [ ] Legacy polling code still exists in some places
- [ ] Some state still in global dicts instead of Redis
- [ ] Database schema could be normalised better
- [ ] Error handling is inconsistent
- [ ] No automated tests
- [ ] Logging could be more structured

---

## Decision Points Needed

1. **Combat Style:** Turn-based (like classic MUDs) or real-time action?  
   **Recommendation:** Turn-based for text-based MUD.
2. **Magic System:** Do we want magic/spells, or keep it low-fantasy?  
   **Recommendation:** Start simple, add magic later if needed.
3. **PvP:** Allow player vs player combat?  
   **Recommendation:** Optional, with consent (duels).
4. **Death Penalty:** What happens when a player dies?  
   **Recommendation:** Lose some gold, respawn at town square (light penalty).
5. **Character Classes:** Do we want classes (warrior, mage, rogue) or classless system?  
   **Recommendation:** Start classless, add classes later if desired.
6. **Guilds:** Do we want guilds/clans?  
   **Recommendation:** Later feature, not critical for MVP.

---

## Success Metrics

Track these to measure progress:

- **Player Retention:** % of players who return after first session
- **Session Length:** Average minutes per session
- **Daily Active Users:** Players who log in daily
- **Command Diversity:** Are players using variety of commands or just a few?
- **Quest Completion:** % of players who complete at least one quest
- **Social Interaction:** How often do players use `tell`, `say`, group up?

---

## Web3, AI & Mobile – Experimentation & Long-Term Vision

Note: You want all of this, but also want to learn about Web3 and AI and integrate both things. None of this is required for MVP.

- **Web3 experiments:**  
  - Explore whether portions of the game (e.g. special items or a gambling den) could exist as Ethereum contracts.  
  - Examples include a richly Asian-themed, smoky but high-class gambling den only open at night where you can gamble using real ETH, or persistent collectible artifacts.

- **AI integration:**  
  - Deepen NPC AI behaviour, emergent quests and dynamic content as described in `docs/IMMERSION_ROADMAP.md`.  
  - Use AI for content generation and NPC initiative while keeping core systems deterministic.

- **Mobile clients:**  
  - Long-term goal: native-feeling iOS and Android apps using a shared framework (e.g. React Native).  
  - Do this only after most of the core roadmap is complete.

- **Lore and theme:**  
  - Maintain a rich and cohesive theme blending Jordan’s *Wheel of Time*, Tolkien’s *Lord of the Rings* and Feist’s *Magician*.  
  - All world content (guilds, clothing, weapons, equipment, descriptions, etc.) should echo the canon established in `docs/LORE_PRIMER.md`.

For the immersion and AI design philosophy that should guide all of these features, see `docs/IMMERSION_ROADMAP.md`.
