In the Update Room, shadows writhe like living ink across walls slick with dampness, their undulating forms hinting at secrets yet untold. The air is thick with the musty aroma of ancient parchment, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of rust that clings to the iron-bound tomes lining the shelves. A soft, persistent drip echoes in the stillness, each droplet a sonorous reminder of time's slow passage, while the floor beneath your feet is cool and slick with moisture, as if the very stones weep for forgotten knowledge. Touching the books' leather spines, you feel the texture of age, the roughened edges whispering of countless hands that have sought their wisdom.
