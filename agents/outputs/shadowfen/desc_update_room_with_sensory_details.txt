The Update Room lies shrouded in a veil of mist, its stone walls slick with eternal dampness. A faint, echoing drip punctuates the silence, each droplet sending ripples across the shallow puddles that pool on the rusted iron floor. The air is thick with the scent of moss and decay, a cloying reminder of the swamp beyond. As you tread carefully, the floor cool and clammy beneath your feet, the tendrils of your breath curl visibly, mingling with the room's spectral fog.
