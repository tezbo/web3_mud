In the Update Room, shadows cling to the rust-streaked walls, their murky depths quivering as if alive. The air is thick with the acrid scent of corroded metal and damp earth, mingling with the faintest whisper of decaying leaves. Soft, almost imperceptible drips echo through the gloom, each splash a reminder of the marshland's encroaching grasp. As you step forward, the slick, uneven stone underfoot presses cold and unyielding against your soles, while a chill breath of wind brushes past, carrying with it the ghostly sighs of forgotten whispers.
