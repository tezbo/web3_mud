The Update Room in the heart of Shadowfen is a symphony of rust and whispers, where walls weep with thin rivulets of moisture, tracing erratic paths down timeworn stone. A faint, acrid scent of mildew mingles with the earthy aroma of damp moss clinging to the corners. The air is heavy, pressing against skin like a damp shroud, while muted echoes of distant drips create a rhythmic lullaby. Flickering lanterns cast fleeting shadows that dance across the floor, their light struggling to pierce the swirling, ethereal mist that clings to the ground like a ghostly veil.
