In the dimly lit Update Room, the walls weep with a patina of rust, their once sharp edges softened by encroaching tendrils of moss. A low hum vibrates through the air, resonating from arcane gears that grind slowly in the shadows, their rhythm as ancient as the swamp itself. The scent of damp earth mingles with a whisper of decay, a testament to the room's place beneath the twisted boughs of Shadowfen. As your fingers brush against a nearby console, the surface is slick and cool, the chill seeping into your skin like the creeping fog outside.
