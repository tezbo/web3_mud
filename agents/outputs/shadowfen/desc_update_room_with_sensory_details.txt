Mist clings to the floor like a living thing, swirling around the legs of rusted iron tables that stand like forgotten sentinels. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a testament to the room's entwinement with the ever-present marsh outside. The walls, cloaked in shadow, weep with moisture, their surfaces slick and cold to the touch. A distant drip echoes through the gloom, each drop resonating like a heartbeat in the silence, while faint whispers seem to wend their way through the mist, giving the unsettling impression of unseen presences.
