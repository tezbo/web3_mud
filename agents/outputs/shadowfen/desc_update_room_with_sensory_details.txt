In the Update Room, shadows drape themselves like heavy velvet across rusted iron walls, their surfaces slick with the perpetual humidity of the Shadowfen. The low, rhythmic drip of unseen water echoes softly, a metronome to the room's silence, while the air carries the scent of damp earth mingled with a faint metallic tang. Underfoot, the floor is uneven, stones cool and slick with moisture, their jagged edges pressing uncomfortably through thin-soled boots. Every breath tastes of moss and mildew, a reminder of the encroaching swamp just beyond these walls.
