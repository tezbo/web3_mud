Wisps of mist slink through the shadowed chamber, clinging to the gnarled roots that twist across the ceiling like skeletal fingers. The air is thick with the earthy scent of damp moss and the faintest hint of decay, interspersed with a metallic tang that lingers on the tongue. A constant drip, drip echoes from unseen corners, a rhythmic counterpoint to the rustle of unseen creatures skittering through the gloom. The stone floor is slick underfoot, its chill seeping through even the sturdiest of boots, as if the room itself seeks to draw warmth from any who dare enter.
