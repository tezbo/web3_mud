In the heart of Shadowfen, the Update Room lies shrouded in perpetual twilight, its air thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint tang of rust. Flickering lanterns cast ghostly shapes upon the walls, their light barely penetrating the swirling mist that clings to every surface like a clammy shroud. The soft, persistent drip of water echoes from unseen corners, creating a rhythmic counterpoint to the distant rustle of unseen creatures. As you step forward, the cold, slick stone underfoot sends a shiver through your spine, and the taste of iron lingers on your tongue, as if the very air holds the memory of ancient, forgotten battles.
