Dimly lit by flickering lanterns, the Update Room is cloaked in a perpetual twilight, where shadows dance along the rusted iron walls like specters performing a mournful ballet. The air is thick with the earthy aroma of damp moss, mingling with the acrid scent of aging parchment stacked precariously on creaking wooden shelves. A distant drip echoes through the stillness, each resonant drop a reminder of the marshland outside, seeping into the very bones of the structure. Beneath your fingers, the stone floor is cool and slick, as if the room itself were perspiring in the humid embrace of the Shadowfen.
