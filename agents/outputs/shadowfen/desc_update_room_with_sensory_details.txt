The Update Room hums with an eerie luminescence, where walls of slick, obsidian stone are veiled in clinging tendrils of mist that swirl like ghostly dancers. A faint, metallic drip echoes from unseen recesses, each drop resonating with the hollow timbre of distant bells. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and rust, reminiscent of ancient iron left to languish in swampy depths. As you step forward, the flagstones beneath your feet are clammy and cold, their surface uneven and slick with a fine layer of moisture, as if the room itself breathes in tandem with the murmur of the mists.
