In the Update Room, shadows cling stubbornly to the corners, weaving a tapestry of darkness against walls streaked with rust. The air is thick with the earthy scent of damp soil, mingling with the faint acrid tang of mildew. A subtle, rhythmic drip echoes from some unseen source, each droplet splattering with a hollow note upon the cracked stone floor. As you step inside, the chill seeps through your boots, the moisture-laden air clinging to your skin like a cool, clammy shroud.
