In the Shadowfen's Update Room, the air hangs heavy with the musty scent of ancient parchment, mingling with the sharp, acrid aroma of rusted metal. Dim lanterns cast flickering shadows across damp stone walls, their light glinting off pools of stagnant water that ripple with unseen disturbances. The floor, slick with moss and the occasional stray vine, yields softly underfoot, while the sound of distant dripping water echoes faintly, a persistent rhythm in the oppressive gloom. A chill seeps through the air, wrapping around you like a cold, clammy mist, as if the room itself whispers forgotten secrets.
