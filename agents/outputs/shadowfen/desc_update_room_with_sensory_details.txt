The Update Room lies shrouded in a perpetual, silvery mist, its air thick with the earthy scent of moss and ancient, decaying leaves. Shadows dance across damp, rust-streaked walls, their surfaces cold and slick to the touch, whispering secrets of bygone eras. A faint dripping echoes through the space, each drop a ghostly heartbeat against the silence, while the tang of stagnant water lingers on the tongue. In the dim light, a mosaic of chipped tiles glints faintly, promising tales of forgotten magic if only one dares to listen.
