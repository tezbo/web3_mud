The air hangs heavy with the musk of damp earth and the faint acrid tang of rusting iron, interwoven with the sweet decay of fallen leaves. Shadows slither along the stone walls, their surfaces slick with moisture, while a cold draft snakes through the narrow space, whispering secrets of the swamp. The distant croak of unseen creatures harmonizes with the rhythmic drip of water, creating a symphony that echoes through the gloom. A single lantern flickers feebly, casting a wavering glow that dances across the jade tiles underfoot, each step releasing a slight chill that seeps up through the soles of your boots.
