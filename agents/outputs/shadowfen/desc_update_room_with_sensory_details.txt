In the heart of Shadowfen, the Update Room is shrouded in a perpetual veil of mist, where every surface glistens with a thin sheen of moisture, giving the stone walls a ghostly sheen under the flickering torchlight. The air is thick with the earthy aroma of damp moss and the sharp, metallic scent of rust, as ancient iron gears grind slowly in the shadows, their rhythmic creaks and groans like whispers from the past. The cold, slick floor sends a chill up through the soles of your boots, while the distant drip of water echoes softly, a constant reminder of the marshland's creeping embrace.
