In the heart of the Shadowfen, the Update Room waits, shrouded in perpetual twilight. The walls, slick with moisture, gleam like wet iron, their surfaces etched with the intricate, rust-red patterns of ancient script. An eerie silence hangs thick, broken only by the occasional drip of water echoing into the gloom. The air is heavy with the musty aroma of decaying leaves, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of old machinery. Underfoot, the floor is a patchwork of cold stone, slick with a thin film of mist that chills the skin and whispers secrets of forgotten times to those who dare to linger.
