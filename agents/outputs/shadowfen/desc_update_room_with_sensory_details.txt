The Update Room lies shrouded in Shadowfen's perpetual gloom, where the air is thick with the scent of damp earth and rusted iron. Faint glimmers of phosphorescent fungi cling to the jagged stone walls, casting ghostly blue patterns that dance like specters. The floor is underfoot with a slick, muddy sheen, each step eliciting a soft squelch that echoes into the ether. A chilling draft snakes through the room, brushing against skin like the whisper of forgotten secrets, carrying with it the faintest undertone of something ancient and decayed.
