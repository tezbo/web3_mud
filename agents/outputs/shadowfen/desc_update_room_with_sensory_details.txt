The Update Room is swathed in a perpetual veil of silvery mist, swirling gently around tarnished iron columns that rise like forgotten sentinels. The air hangs heavy with the earthy scent of damp moss and the faint tang of rust, as if the room itself breathes with the rhythm of the encroaching fen. Underfoot, the floor is slick with moisture, each step producing a soft squelch that echoes softly through the chamber, occasionally punctuated by the distant drip of water. Pale, flickering lanterns cast ghostly reflections across the jade-inlaid walls, their glow revealing intricate patterns that shift and dance, whispering secrets long buried in the murky depths.
