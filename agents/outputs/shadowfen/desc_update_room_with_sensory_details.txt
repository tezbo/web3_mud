The Update Room hovers in perpetual twilight, where tendrils of mist weave around columns of weathered rust. The air hums with an eerie, low-frequency vibration, as if the walls themselves whisper secrets in a forgotten tongue. A faint scent of damp earth clings to the skin, mingled with an elusive trace of sulfur. As your fingertips brush the walls, they feel cool and slick, like the skin of some ancient, slumbering beast. Shadows flicker in the corners, dancing to the rhythm of unseen breaths.
