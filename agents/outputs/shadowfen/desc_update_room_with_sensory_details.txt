Veils of whispering mist coil languidly around the ancient stone walls of the Update Room, where the air tastes faintly of rust and damp earth. Flickering candlelight dances across the jade inlaid floor, casting spectral shadows that seem to breathe with the pulse of the swamp beyond. The soft drone of unseen insects hums through the air, a lullaby that mingles with the hollow drip of water trickling down the walls. Each breath fills your lungs with the cool, mossy scent of the fen, and the rough-hewn wooden table, slick with condensation, feels alive beneath your fingertips.
