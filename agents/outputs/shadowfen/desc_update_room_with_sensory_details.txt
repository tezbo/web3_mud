Within the Update Room of Shadowfen, the air is thick with the tang of damp earth and the faint whisper of decaying leaves. Shadows dance along walls streaked with tendrils of creeping rust, and the only light comes from lichen that glows a ghostly green. The floor, slick with an unnameable moisture, squelches underfoot, each step releasing the musty scent of ancient secrets long buried. A distant drip echoes through the chamber, a rhythmic reminder of the swamp's slow encroachment.
