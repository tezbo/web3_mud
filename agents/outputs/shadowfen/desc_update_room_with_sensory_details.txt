In the Update Room, shadows weave intricate patterns across walls streaked with rust, the damp air clinging to skin like a cold, unwelcome embrace. A chorus of whispers echoes through the gloom, each hushed breath carrying secrets of the past, as if the walls themselves remembered. The tang of mildew and ancient iron lingers in the air, mingling with the earthy aroma of moss that carpets the floor in a muted, velvety green. Flickering lanterns cast a sickly, wavering light, their glass panes clouded with age, casting the room in a perpetual twilight.
