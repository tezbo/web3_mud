Veils of mist cling to the damp stone walls, their chill seeping through to your bones. The air is thick with the scent of wet earth and decay, punctuated by the faint, coppery tang of rust. Dripping water echoes in the silence, each drop a hollow reminder of the passage of time. Shadows pool in the corners, shifting and stretching as if alive, their presence felt like a gentle brush against your skin. The floor, slick with moisture, offers a treacherous path beneath your feet.
