The air in the Update Room is thick with the earthy musk of moss clinging to the stone walls, their surfaces slick with the perpetual damp of the Shadowfen. A faint, persistent drip echoes from the ceiling, punctuating the murmur of distant croaks and rustling leaves outside. Flickering lanterns cast ghostly shadows that dance across the room, their light catching on the rusted gears and ancient mechanisms strewn across a heavy oak table. As you trail your fingers along the moisture-beaded walls, a chill seeps into your bones, and the metallic taste of stagnation lingers on your tongue like a forgotten secret.
