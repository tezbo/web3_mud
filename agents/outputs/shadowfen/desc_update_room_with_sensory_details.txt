The Update Room lies shrouded in a perpetual gloom, where the air is thick with the aroma of damp earth and decaying leaves. Flickering lanterns cast wavering shadows across the rust-stained walls, their dim light barely piercing the mist that clings to every surface. The distant drip of water echoes through the space, a steady rhythm that mingles with the soft rustle of unseen creatures skittering in the dark. The stone floor is slick and cold beneath your feet, each step sending a shiver up your spine, as if the walls themselves exhale a frigid breath upon your skin.
