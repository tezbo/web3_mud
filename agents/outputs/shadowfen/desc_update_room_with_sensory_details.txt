The Update Room huddles within the Shadowfen's embrace, its walls weeping with perpetual dampness that clings to the skin like a shroud. Flickering lanterns cast jittery shadows, their flickering light dancing across rusted gears and ancient, moss-covered mechanisms that groan with the weight of forgotten time. The air is thick with the musty scent of mildew, mingling with a faint metallic tang that hints at arcane machinery long dormant. Each step on the stone floor echoes with a hollow, waterlogged sound, as if the room itself is whispering secrets of an age drowned in twilight.
