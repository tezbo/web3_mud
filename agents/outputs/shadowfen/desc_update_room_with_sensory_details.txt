In the heart of Shadowfen, the Update Room lies shrouded in a perpetual haze, where the air feels thick with the weight of secrets whispered and unspoken. The walls, slick with moss, glisten dully in the dim light filtering through cracked panes overhead, casting ghostly patterns on the flooded stone floor. A faint, acrid scent of rust and stagnant water fills the air, mingling with the soft, rhythmic drip of moisture seeping from the ceiling. As you step forward, the chill of the water seeps through your boots, a reminder of the forgotten past lurking beneath the surface.
