In the Update Room, shadows dance along the pitted walls, the dim light from a solitary lantern casting flickering patterns that seem to shift and slither. The air is thick and damp, carrying the earthy aroma of decaying leaves and the faintest hint of iron. A low, almost imperceptible hum vibrates through the floor, resonating with the uneven rhythm of droplets falling into a distant pool. The wooden floorboards, slick with moisture, creak softly underfoot, each step a whisper in the murky gloom.
