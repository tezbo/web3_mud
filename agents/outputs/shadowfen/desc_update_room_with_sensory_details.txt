The Update Room sits shrouded in a tapestry of mist, where dim, flickering lanterns cast ghostly reflections on the damp, rust-streaked walls. The air hums with a low, resonant thrum, like the heartbeat of some slumbering beast, punctuated by the occasional drip of condensation from the ceiling. A metallic tang lingers, merging with the earthy aroma of moss and decay. As you step further, the cold, slick floor sends a shiver through your soles, grounding you in the somber embrace of Shadowfen's forgotten secrets.
