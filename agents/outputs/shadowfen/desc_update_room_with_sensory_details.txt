Mist clings to the stone walls, beading like cold sweat, while rusted iron gears groan and creak overhead, their echoes swallowed by the dense fog. The air is thick with the pungent scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, mingling with a faint metallic tang that lingers on the tongue. As your fingers brush against the walls, they come away slick and gritty, a tactile reminder of the room's age and neglect. Shadows dance in the dim light of flickering, oil-drenched lanterns, casting a wavering glow that reveals and conceals in equal measure.
