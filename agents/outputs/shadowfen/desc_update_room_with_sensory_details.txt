The Update Room lies shrouded in a perpetual gloom, where the air is thick with the scent of damp earth and rusted iron. Shadows dance across the walls, their movement dictated by the flickering light of lanterns that sputter and hiss like whispering spirits. The stone floor is slick beneath your feet, a chill seeping up through your soles, while the walls are rough to the touch, their surfaces etched with cryptic symbols that pulse with an eerie phosphorescence. In the silence, you can hear the distant drip of water echoing like a forgotten heartbeat, creating a rhythm that feels both ancient and unsettlingly alive.
