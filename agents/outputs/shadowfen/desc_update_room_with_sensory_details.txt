In the dim glow of lanterns, the Update Room emerges like a forgotten relic, its stone walls slick with the persistent breath of Shadowfen's mist. The air is thick and musky, a blend of damp earth and the faint, acrid trace of long-extinguished fires. Each step across the uneven, rust-tinged floor echoes softly, swallowed by the oppressive silence, save for the distant drip of water finding its path through the gloom. The chill is palpable, seeping through fabric and flesh, as if the room itself yearns to share its secrets with those who dare to linger.
