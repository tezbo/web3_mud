Muffled whispers echo through the damp stone chamber, their source hidden in the tendrils of mist that coil languidly around the rust-streaked walls. The air is thick with the scent of mold and the sharp, acrid bite of stagnant water, clinging to the skin like a clammy shroud. Shadows dance across the uneven floor, cast by the flickering light of guttering torches, their flames swaying in the chill drafts that slither past. Beneath your feet, the ground is uneven, slick with a film of moisture that makes each step a cautious venture into the unknown.
