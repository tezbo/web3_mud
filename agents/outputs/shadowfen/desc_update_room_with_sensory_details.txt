The Update Room in Shadowfen breathes with a damp, musty air, its walls woven from twisted roots and clinging moss that glisten with dew. Flickering witchlights hover in the corners, casting eerie shadows that dance over the rusted iron machinery, their metallic groans echoing like whispers of ancient secrets. The floor is soft beneath your feet, a carpet of spongy peat that squelches quietly with each step, releasing the faint aroma of decaying leaves and earth. In the air lingers a metallic tang, mingling with the bitter scent of swamp herbs, as if the room itself exhaled the essence of the fen.
