The Update Room in Shadowfen hums with a low, rhythmic vibration, as if the walls themselves breathe with arcane energy. Mist coils languidly around the rust-streaked machinery, the air thick with the pungent aroma of wet earth and decay. Flickering lanterns cast a murky, amber glow, their light dancing across surfaces slick with condensation. The cold, damp air clings to the skin, each step echoing with a hollow, metallic ring that reverberates through the shadowed corridors.
