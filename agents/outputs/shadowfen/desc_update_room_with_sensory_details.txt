In the heart of Shadowfen, the Update Room lies shrouded in an eternal dusk, where the air is thick with the scent of damp earth and ancient rust. Mist clings to the walls, its cool fingers grazing your skin as it swirls in ghostly patterns through beams of wan moonlight filtering from high, cracked windows. Every step on the uneven flagstone floor echoes softly, a whisper swallowed by the oppressive silence. The faint, metallic taste of decay lingers on your tongue, mingling with the distant, musky aroma of wet leaves and stagnant water.
