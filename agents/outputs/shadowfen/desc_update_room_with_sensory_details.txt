The Update Room in Shadowfen exudes an aura of eerie anticipation, its walls slick with a shimmering patina of moss that clings like a second skin. A faint chorus of dripping water echoes through the dim space, each droplet sounding like a whispered secret. The air is thick with the tang of rust and stagnant water, a metallic scent that coats the tongue. Flickering swamp gas lanterns cast ghostly jade shadows that dance across the floor, their light revealing the occasional scuttling of unseen creatures. As you step forward, the floor shifts subtly beneath your feet, each movement greeted by a soft squelch of sodden earth.
