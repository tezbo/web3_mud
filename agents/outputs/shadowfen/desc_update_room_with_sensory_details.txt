In the heart of Shadowfen, the Update Room breathes with a whispering gloom, its walls cloaked in a tapestry of moss and creeping ivy that weeps with the slow drip of moisture. A dim, greenish light filters through the murk, cast by phosphorescent fungi clinging to the ceiling like pale stars in a twilight sky. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint, metallic hint of rust, as if the room itself is slowly decaying. Underfoot, the floor is slick and uneven, the texture of ancient stone softened by the encroaching moss, while the distant croak of unseen frogs punctuates the heavy silence.
