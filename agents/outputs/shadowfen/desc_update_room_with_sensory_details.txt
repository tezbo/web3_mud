The Update Room lies shrouded in a thick, clinging mist that curls around your ankles, its chill seeping through worn boots to gnaw at your skin. Muffled whispers echo off the rust-tinged stone walls, the words indistinct yet hauntingly familiar, like half-remembered dreams. The air is heavy with the damp, earthy scent of decaying leaves, mingling with a faint, metallic tang that lingers at the back of your throat. Your fingers brush against the slick surface of a jade altar, the stone cool and unnervingly smooth, as if polished by centuries of unseen hands.
