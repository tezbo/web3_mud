Veils of mist drift languidly through the Update Room, their ghostly tendrils weaving between tarnished iron shelves. The air is thick with the earthy perfume of damp moss and the faint, acrid bite of rust. A distant drip echoes softly, each drop a gentle percussion in the pervasive silence. The stone floor is cool beneath your feet, slick with condensation, as if the very room breathes with the dampness of the fen. Pale light filters through a narrow window, casting shifting patterns of shadow that dance across the walls like restless spirits.
