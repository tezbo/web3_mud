In the dim recesses of the Shadowfen's Update Room, the air hangs thick with the earthy musk of damp moss and ancient wood. Flickering candlelight dances across rusted metal consoles, casting elongated shadows that slither like restless spirits. The soft drip of condensation echoes through the chamber, each drop landing with a cold, wet sting on the stone floor, where the mist swirls in languid tendrils around your ankles. A faint, bittersweet taste of decay clings to the back of your throat, mingling with the scent of mildew and forgotten secrets.
