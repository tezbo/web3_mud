Veils of mist twist languidly through the Update Room, their fingers curling around tarnished iron cogs that jut from the walls like ancient relics. A faint, rhythmic ticking echoes in the shadows, as if the room itself marks the passage of time in its own secret language. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth mingled with the acrid bite of rust, evoking an unsettling blend of decay and persistence. Touching the rough stone walls, your fingertips graze over patches of moss, cool and slick, as if the room holds memories of a swamp long forgotten.
