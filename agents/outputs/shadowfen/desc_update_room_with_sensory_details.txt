The Update Room in Shadowfen exudes an aura of ancient mystery, its walls cloaked in creeping tendrils of moss that glisten with the moisture of perpetual mist. A low hum vibrates through the floor, resonating from unseen mechanisms, while the air carries the earthy scent of damp stone mingled with a faint, metallic tang. Shadowy figures carved into the rust-colored walls seem to shift in the flickering light of guttering lanterns, casting elongated shadows that dance like specters. As you brush your fingers along the cool, slick surface of a nearby console, the chill seeps into your skin, sending a shiver up your spine.
