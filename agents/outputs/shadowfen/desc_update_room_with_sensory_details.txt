In the heart of Shadowfen, the Update Room exudes an aura of mystery, cloaked in perpetual twilight where mist clings to the uneven, rust-streaked walls. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, mingling with the faint, acrid tang of iron. A soft, almost imperceptible drip echoes from the ceiling, its rhythm broken only by the whisper of shadowy figures shuffling in the corners. The stone floor is cool and slick beneath your feet, each step sending a shiver up your spine as if the room itself is alive, breathing in tandem with the mist.
