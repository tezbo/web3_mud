In the dimly lit Update Room of Shadowfen, the air hangs heavy with the earthy mustiness of damp wood and ancient stone. Tendrils of mist coil languidly around the rusted gears and levers that protrude from the walls, their surfaces slick and cold to the touch. A rhythmic, metallic ticking echoes softly, like a heartbeat pulsing through the gloom, while the faint, acrid scent of ozone hints at the arcane energies coursing through unseen conduits. Ghostly blue light flickers from shattered glass tubes, casting wavering shadows that dance like specters across the damp floor.
