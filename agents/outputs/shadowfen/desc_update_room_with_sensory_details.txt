The Update Room in Shadowfen is shrouded in a perpetual twilight, where the walls seem to shift and breathe like the mist that coils around them. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and the faint, metallic tang of rust, as if the room itself is a relic of forgotten ages. Soft whispers, like the rustle of dry leaves, echo from the corners, creating an unsettling symphony with the occasional drip of unseen water. Underfoot, the floor is slick and uneven, the cold stone pressing up like the chill of an unwelcome memory. Fleeting shadows dance across your periphery, teasing the edges of sight as if the very darkness is alive.
