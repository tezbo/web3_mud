In the Update Room of Shadowfen, tendrils of mist seep through the narrow windows, curling around rusted iron candelabras that cast flickering shadows on damp stone walls. The air is thick with the scent of decaying leaves and the faint tang of mildew, a reminder of the swamp that stretches beyond. Every step on the moss-covered floor releases a squelch, as if the earth itself were whispering secrets. The only sound is the distant, rhythmic drip of water, echoing like a heartbeat in the stillness, while the chill of the room wraps around you like a damp shroud.
