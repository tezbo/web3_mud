The Update Room sits shrouded in a near-perpetual twilight, its stone walls slick with a sheen of moisture that clings like an unwelcome whisper. Flickering lanterns cast wavering shadows across the floor, where moss creeps in tendrils of deep green, exhaling a faint, earthy musk. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the distant, acrid bite of rotting foliage, mingling with the soft, rhythmic drip of water echoing in the stillness. As you run your fingers along the rust-pitted iron of the railings, a chill seeps into your skin, the metal cool and unyielding beneath your touch.
