The Update Room in Shadowfen is a dim sanctuary where the air hangs heavy with the musty scent of aged parchment and damp earth. Flickering candlelight dances across walls adorned with rusted iron sconces, casting wavering shadows like restless phantoms. A soft, incessant drip echoes from the stone ceiling, punctuating the silence as rivulets of water leave trails on the cool, slick floor. The tang of iron lingers in the air, while the chill of the flagstones seeps through your boots, grounding you in this twilight realm of forgotten knowledge.
