The Update Room in Shadowfen is a dim sanctuary where shadows dance across rust-veined walls, their surfaces cool and slick with the perpetual mist that clings to every surface. A faint drip echoes, a rhythmic metronome against the unsettling silence that swallows even the faintest whisper. The air is thick with the earthy aroma of damp moss, undercut by an acrid tang of iron that lingers at the back of the throat. As you step further inside, your fingers brush against the jagged edges of ancient gears protruding from the walls, their metal teeth cold and unyielding, whispering of forgotten time.
