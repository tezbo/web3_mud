Veins of rust weave through the damp stone walls, exuding a metallic tang that mingles with the earthy scent of moss clinging to crevices. Pale moonlight filters through cracked, slatted windows, casting fractured shadows that dance across the floor like ghostly wraiths. The faint drip of water echoes through the chamber, a rhythmic heartbeat in the otherwise silent gloom. As you brush against the walls, your fingertips graze the cool, slick surface, leaving a faint chill lingering on your skin.
