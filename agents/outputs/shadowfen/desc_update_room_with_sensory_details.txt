The Update Room in the heart of Shadowfen is a dim sanctuary where shadows cling like a second skin. Muffled whispers echo off corroded iron walls, their origins obscured by the heavy, lingering fog. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the acrid bite of rust, a testament to the room's eternal battle with the encroaching bog. Underfoot, the floor is slick with condensation, each step a cautious negotiation with the treacherous stone. A single, flickering lantern casts a pallid glow, revealing glimpses of ancient runes etched into the walls, their meanings as elusive as the room’s secrets.
