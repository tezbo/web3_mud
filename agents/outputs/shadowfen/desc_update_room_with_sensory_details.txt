The Update Room in Shadowfen is a silent sanctuary where time seems to hesitate. Shadows dance across damp stone walls, their shapes shifting like whispers in the fog. A faint rustling echoes as tattered scrolls, aged and brittle, sway gently from corroded iron hooks. The air is thick with the earthy scent of moss and decaying parchment, mingling with a metallic tang that lingers on the tongue. Cold seeps through your boots from the slick floor, and the occasional drip of unseen water sends shivers up your spine.
