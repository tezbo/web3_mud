The Update Room in Shadowfen is draped in shadows that cling like mist to the walls, each breath of the damp air carrying the scent of wet earth and decaying leaves. A faint rustling whispers through the gloom, as if unseen creatures skitter just beyond sight, their presence unsettling yet familiar. The cold stone floor is slick beneath your feet, its chill seeping up through your soles to settle in your bones. Flickering lanterns cast erratic pools of light, their flames sputtering as if gasping for breath in the heavy, oppressive atmosphere.
