The Update Room in the heart of Shadowfen is a sanctuary of shadow and decay, where the air is thick with the aroma of damp earth and rotting leaves. Flickering lanterns, their glass panes clouded with age, cast wavering pools of dim light across walls streaked with rust and lichen. The floor beneath is a patchwork of slick moss and cold stone, each step a whispered sigh as moisture seeps up between the cracks. In the corners, the distant drip of water echoes like a forgotten memory, and the soft rustle of unseen creatures stirs an unsettling chill along the spine.
