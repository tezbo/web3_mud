In the Update Room, shadows dance across walls streaked with the rust of ages, their patterns like ancient, whispering runes. The air is thick with the earthy scent of damp moss, mingled with the faint metallic bite of corroded iron. Each step on the warped wooden floor sends a low creak echoing into the murk, as if the room itself is breathing. Faint drafts caress the skin, cold and insistent, while the distant drip of water is a steady, haunting percussion in the stillness.
