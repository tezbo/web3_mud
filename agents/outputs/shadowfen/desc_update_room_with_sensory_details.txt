The Update Room in Shadowfen is a sanctuary of whispers and echoes, where the walls, slick with perpetual dampness, shimmer like obsidian under flickering candlelight. The air is thick with the earthy aroma of moss and the sharp, metallic bite of rust, as if the room itself were slowly being reclaimed by the swamp. A faint drip of water resonates in the corners, each droplet a soft percussion against the stone, while the floor feels cool and slightly yielding beneath your feet, as if it has settled on layers of peat. Your fingers graze the rough-hewn surface of a wooden table, its grain worn smooth by countless hands, and a tangy metallic taste lingers in the air, as if the atmosphere itself were charged with secrets waiting to be unveiled.
