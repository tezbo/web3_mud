The Update Room in the heart of Shadowfen breathes with an eerie life of its own, where tendrils of mist curl lazily around rusted metal consoles, their surfaces slick to the touch and cold as forgotten steel. The air is thick with the cloying scent of damp earth and decaying foliage, mingling with a sharp undertone of ozone that hints at archaic, arcane energies at play. A low hum reverberates through the chamber, a discordant symphony of whispers and echoes that seem to seep from the very walls, woven with strands of moss and shadow. Dim, flickering lanterns cast a wavering glow, painting the room in shades of gray and deep green, where the boundary between the seen and the unseen blurs like a half-remembered dream.
