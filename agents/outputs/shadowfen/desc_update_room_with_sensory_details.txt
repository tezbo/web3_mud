A shroud of mist clings to the walls, its tendrils curling around the rusted iron sconces that flicker weakly with ghostly blue flames. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and decay, as if the room itself is crumbling into the mire outside. Each step on the uneven stone floor sends a whispering echo, like distant voices trapped in the walls. The chill in the room is palpable, seeping through your clothes, and when you touch the moss-covered stone, it feels as if the very marrow of your bones is being drawn into the cold.
