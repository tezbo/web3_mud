Veils of mist cling to the rough stone walls, their icy tendrils brushing against your skin as you step into the Update Room. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and ancient rust, mingling with the faint, acrid odor of something electrical. A soft, rhythmic hum pulses through the room, vibrating through the floor and resonating in your bones. Dim, flickering lights cast eerie shadows that dance across the walls, illuminating a network of corroded gears and levers, their metal surfaces slick with condensation.
