A faint mist clings to the stone walls, dripping moisture that paints trails upon the rust-streaked surface. The air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a whisper of the swamp just beyond. Shadows slither across the floor, shifting with the flicker of a single, guttering torch that spits and hisses in its sconce. Each footstep is muffled, absorbed by the thick layer of moss that carpets the cold, uneven floor, giving the room an eerie, soundless quality.
