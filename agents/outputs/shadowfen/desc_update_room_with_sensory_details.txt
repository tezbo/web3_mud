The Update Room hums with an eerie, low vibration that seems to seep through the rust-streaked walls, each pulse resonating with the metallic taste of anticipation. Pale, spectral light filters through the swamp’s perpetual mist, casting wavering shadows that dance upon the floor like ghostly moths. The air is thick with the pungent aroma of damp earth and decaying vegetation, a reminder of the ever-encroaching bog outside. Underfoot, the floor is slick and uneven, covered in a thin film of algae that clings like a cold, clammy hand.
