Veils of mist curl languidly around the crumbling stone walls, their damp tendrils leaving a chill upon any exposed skin. Faint echoes of dripping water resonate through the gloom, a steady patter that reverberates like a distant heartbeat. The air is thick with the earthy scent of moss and decay, mingling with the acrid tang of rusting iron chains that hang from the ceiling. Underfoot, the floor is slick with moisture, each step a soft squelch that seems to be swallowed by the pervasive murk.
