In the Update Room of Shadowfen, the air hangs heavy with an earthy dampness, as if the mist itself has seeped into the stone walls. The dim glow of bioluminescent fungi casts eerie patterns across the rusted metal consoles, their surfaces cool and slick to the touch. A soft, rhythmic dripping echoes from somewhere unseen, a metronome to the silent dance of shadows that flit across moss-covered floors. The scent of decaying leaves and rich, black soil envelops you, mingling with the faint metallic tang of old machinery lingering like a ghost of forgotten technology.
