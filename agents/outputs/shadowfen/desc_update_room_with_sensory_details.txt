Shadows drape the Update Room like a velvet shroud, their inky tendrils interweaving with tendrils of mist that cling to the rusted iron walls. The air carries a damp, earthy scent, mingled with a metallic tang, as if the very essence of the fen has seeped into the room's bones. Each footstep echoes with a dull thud, softened by the moss that carpets the stone floor, cool and yielding beneath the feet. A soft, incessant drip of water plays a rhythmic counterpoint, its source hidden within the dim recesses, while the faint taste of iron lingers on the tongue, a reminder of Shadowfen's ancient, secretive heart.
