- **Exploration and Convenience**: The layout encourages exploration with immediate access to common needs (Tavern, Alchemist's Shop) while maintaining a realistic sense of distance and purpose.

- **Central Hub**: Market Square is designed to be a high-traffic area where players naturally converge, with all other rooms purposefully branching from it for ease of navigation.

- **Realism**: The layout reflects a typical town center with a blend of commerce, security, and social interaction, balancing convenience with a sense of a lived-in world.
