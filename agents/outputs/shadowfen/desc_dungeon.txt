In the heart of Shadowfen, the dungeon looms, its walls a tapestry of damp stone and creeping lichen, glistening with a sinister, oily sheen. The air is thick with the acrid stench of decay mingled with the earthy musk of stagnant water, clinging to your skin like an unwelcome caress. From the darkness, the soft drip of moisture echoes, a rhythmic whisper that teases the edges of sanity. Underfoot, the floor is a treacherous patchwork of slick moss and rusting chains, each step a cautious negotiation with the shadows.
