In the heart of Shadowfen's murky underbelly lies a dungeon where the air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and rusting chains. Flickering torchlight casts jagged shadows that dance across the rough-hewn stone walls, their surface slick and cold to the touch, whispering tales of ancient despair. The soft drip-drip of water echoes through the corridors, a haunting lullaby woven with the distant skittering of unseen creatures. A metallic tang lingers on the tongue, mingling with the bitter taste of decay that clings to the back of the throat, as if the dungeon itself breathes a long-forgotten sorrow.
