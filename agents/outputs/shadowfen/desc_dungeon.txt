In the heart of Shadowfen's dungeon, the air hangs heavy with the musty scent of damp earth and rusting iron. Flickering torchlight casts jittery shadows that dance across walls slick with moisture, their surfaces mottled and uneven beneath your fingertips. The distant drip of water echoes through the corridors, a mournful symphony punctuated by the occasional scuttle of unseen creatures. The metallic taste of fear lingers on the tongue, as if the very stones exhale the despair of those long forgotten.
