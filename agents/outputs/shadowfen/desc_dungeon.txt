The air hangs heavy with the musty scent of damp earth, mingling with the sharp, metallic odor of rusted chains clinking softly in the darkness. Faint shafts of moonlight struggle through the barred window, painting ghostly patterns on the slick, stone walls, their surfaces cold and clammy to the touch. Water drips rhythmically from the ceiling, each drop echoing in the silence like a somber heartbeat. A lurking chill seeps into bones, as if the shadows themselves are alive, whispering secrets from ages long past.
