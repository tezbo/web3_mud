The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and rusting chains, a clammy mist clinging to the stone walls. Faint echoes of dripping water reverberate through the dim chamber, each drop a ghostly reminder of time’s relentless passage. Underfoot, the floor is slick with moss and treacherous to the touch, like the skin of some lurking creature. Shadows writhe in the corners, their forms shifting as if alive, inviting a chill to crawl up your spine.
