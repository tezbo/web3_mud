The dungeon exudes a damp chill, each stone of its walls slick with a sheen of moisture that clings to your skin like a cold whisper. The air is thick with the musk of mildew, underscored by the faint, metallic tang of rusted chains swaying gently from the ceiling. Shadows dance erratically across the uneven floor, their flickering shapes cast by the guttering flames of torches ensconced in corroded iron brackets. A distant drip echoes through the corridors, a rhythmic reminder of the world's slow decay, while the taste of earth and time lingers on your tongue.
