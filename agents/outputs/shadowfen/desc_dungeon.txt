In the depths of Shadowfen, the dungeon whispers with an unsettling symphony of dripping water and distant, dissonant echoes. The air hangs heavy with the musty scent of damp earth and iron, as if the walls themselves weep with forgotten sorrows. Jagged stones, slick with moss, jut from the floor, their chill seeping through leather boots with a clammy persistence. Shadows coil in every corner, shifting like living things, promising secrets and danger in equal measure.
