The dungeon stretches out like a maw of darkness, its stone walls slick with creeping tendrils of moss, glistening under the dim glow of flickering torchlight. A pervasive chill clings to the air, carrying the musty odor of damp earth intertwined with the sharper scent of rusting iron. Each step echoes ominously, the sound swallowed by the oppressive silence that seems to pulse with an ancient, unknowable rhythm. As you trail your fingers along the rough-hewn walls, the gritty texture bites back, a reminder of the countless souls who have passed through this shadowed corridor.
