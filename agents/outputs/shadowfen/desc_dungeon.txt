The dungeon's air is thick with the scent of damp stone and rust, a metallic bite that clings to the tongue. Shadows coil in the corners, where slick walls glisten with a perpetual sheen of moisture. The distant drip of water echoes, each plop a ghostly heartbeat in the oppressive stillness. Underfoot, the flagstones are treacherous, worn smooth by time and slick with unseen slime, sending shivers up your spine whenever boot slips. The dim glow of a single lantern casts long, wavering shadows, flickering like specters that dance just at the edge of vision.
