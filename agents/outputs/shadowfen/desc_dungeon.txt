The dungeon crouches beneath the surface like a forgotten beast, its walls slick with moss and the scent of decay. Echoes of dripping water punctuate the oppressive silence, each drop a ghostly reminder of time's passage. A chill clings to the air, seeping into your skin, as the rough stone underfoot yields a gritty, rust-tinged dampness. The dim glow of luminescent fungi casts eerie shadows that writhe like specters, hinting at secrets entombed in the gloom.
