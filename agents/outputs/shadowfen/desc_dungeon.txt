In the heart of the Shadowfen dungeon, shadows cling to moss-slicked stones, whispering secrets lost to time. The air hangs heavy with the musty aroma of damp earth and the faint, coppery scent of rust. Each footstep echoes with a hollow thud, swallowed by the oppressive silence that presses like a shroud against your skin. Flickers of torchlight dance across the jagged walls, their flickering glow casting eerie, distorted silhouettes that slither and writhe in the corners of your vision.
