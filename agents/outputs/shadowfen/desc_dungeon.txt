In the shadow-choked dungeon of Shadowfen, the air hangs heavy with the acrid scent of mildew and rust, a testament to years of neglect. Torchlight flickers feebly against the slick stone walls, casting jagged shadows that dance like specters in the gloom. The distant drip of water echoes through the corridors, each drop a cold finger tracing the spine. The ground underfoot is uneven, strewn with gravel and the occasional jagged shard of bone, while a pervasive chill seeps through leather and skin alike.
