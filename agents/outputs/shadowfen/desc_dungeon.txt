The dungeon sprawls beneath the earth like a forgotten warren, its walls slick with the perpetual embrace of creeping damp. A chill mist clings to the floor, swirling around your ankles with each cautious step, while the air is thick with the scent of mildew and ancient rust. The distant drip of water echoes through the passageways, a haunting rhythm that underscores the oppressive silence. Every surface is cold to the touch, a clammy reminder of the shadows that twist and dance across the jagged stone, cast by flickering torches that sputter with a sickly, greenish light.
