The air in the dungeon is thick and damp, clinging to the skin like a shroud of cold mist. Faint echoes of dripping water resonate against the corroded iron bars, each drop a ghostly whisper in the dim light. A musty stench of decaying leaves and rust permeates the space, mingling with the acrid odor of ancient stone. As your fingers brush against the slick, moss-covered walls, the chill seeps into your bones, leaving a lingering chill that refuses to fade.
