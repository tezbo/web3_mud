In the murky depths of the Shadowfen dungeon, shadows writhe like living things across damp stone walls, their surfaces mottled with the dark stains of time. The air hangs heavy with the musty scent of mold and iron, a cloying reminder of forgotten captives. The distant drip of water echoes eerily, each drop a solitary note in a symphony of silence. Underfoot, the ground is slick with a thin film of moisture, cold and unyielding, as if the stones themselves have absorbed centuries of despair.
