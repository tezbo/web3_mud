In the depths of Shadowfen's dungeon, shadows coil like living things, swallowing the feeble light that dares intrude. The air hangs heavy with the damp, earthy scent of moss and decay, punctuated by the occasional metallic bite of rusted chains. Each step echoes against the cold stone floor, the sound swallowed by the oppressive silence. A chill seeps through the walls, its clammy fingers brushing against your skin, while the distant drip of water creates an eerie rhythm that both soothes and unnerves.
