In the heart of Shadowfen's dungeon, darkness clings to the cold, slick stone walls like a shroud. Faint echoes of dripping water punctuate the oppressive silence, while the air is thick with the musty scent of decay and rusting iron. Each step is met with the clammy grasp of the flagstone floor, slick with moisture, and the metallic tang of mold hangs heavily on the tongue. Shadows shift uneasily in the dim glow of torches guttering weakly in their sconces, casting flickering specters that dance with every flick of the flame.
