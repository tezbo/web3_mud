In the depths of Shadowfen's dungeon, shadows cling to the damp stone walls like ancient secrets, the dim light barely penetrating the murk. The air is thick with the musk of decay, mingling with the acrid tang of rusting iron bars, their surfaces cool and slick beneath a tentative touch. Each step echoes with a hollow resonance, accompanied by the distant drip of water that falls with a rhythmic, hollow cadence. A faint chill licks at your skin, leaving a ghostly trail that raises the fine hairs on your arms, as if the very air itself is alive with whispers of the past.
