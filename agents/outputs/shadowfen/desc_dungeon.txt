In the heart of the Shadowfen, the dungeon breathes with a chill that seeps through walls of damp, moss-covered stone. A perpetual mist snakes along the floor, curling around your ankles with a clammy embrace, while the distant drip of water echoes like a forgotten lament. The air is thick with the scent of decay, mingling with the metallic tang of rust and old iron from the chains that hang like spectral sentinels. Flickering torchlight casts wavering shadows that dance and sway, painting stories of despair across every surface.
