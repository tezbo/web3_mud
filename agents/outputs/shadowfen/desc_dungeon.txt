In the heart of the Shadowfen, the dungeon yawns like a forgotten wound, its stone walls slick with a perennial sheen of moisture. The air is thick with the acrid scent of rust and stagnant water, clinging to the back of your throat with each breath. A distant drip echoes through the corridors, a rhythmic reminder of the world above, while a faint chill seeps through your boots, numbing your toes. Shadows dance with the flicker of torches, their light casting jagged silhouettes that seem to shift and whisper secrets only the darkness understands.
