In the dungeon of Shadowfen, a dank chill clings to the air, wrapping itself around you like a shroud. The walls, slick with moisture, glisten in the dim, flickering torchlight, casting elongated shadows that dance with eerie intent. The distant drip of water echoes through the narrow corridors, a rhythmic reminder of the world above, while the scent of mildew and rust saturates your senses, mingling with the faint, coppery tang of forgotten blood. The rough stone underfoot is uneven and cold, each step sending a shiver up your spine, as if the very ground resents your intrusion.
