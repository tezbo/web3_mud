The dungeon looms beneath the earth, where the air hangs thick with the musty tang of mildew and the acrid bite of rusting chains. Flickering torchlight paints the stone walls in trembling shadows, each dark corner whispering secrets long forgotten. The distant drip of water echoes through the corridors, a somber rhythm that hums against the skin like a cold, persistent shiver. The floor, slick with a thin film of moisture, sends a chill through the soles of your boots, while the taste of damp earth lingers hauntingly on your tongue.
