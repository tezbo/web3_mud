In the heart of the Shadowfen, the dungeon stretches out like a forgotten maw, its stone walls slick with moisture and streaked with the rusty fingers of time. The air is thick with a damp, earthy aroma, tinged with the metallic bite of decay. The distant drip of water echoes through the corridors, each drop a ghostly whisper against the silence. As you tread carefully, the ground beneath your feet feels uneven, the stones cold and unyielding, while a chill clings to your skin, seeping through to your bones. Shadows dance along the walls, flickering in the dim glow of moss-covered lanterns, casting eerie shapes that seem to breathe with the dungeon itself.
