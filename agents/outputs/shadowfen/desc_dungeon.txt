The dungeon breathes with the damp, clinging chill of Shadowfen, where walls of crumbling stone weep with stagnant moisture. A faint echo of dripping water punctuates the oppressive silence, each drop a ghostly reminder of time forgotten. The air is thick with the pungent aroma of mildew and rust, mingling with the earthy scent of decaying leaves from the world above. As your fingers brush the slick surface of the iron bars, they leave a trail through the cold, gritty grime, a tactile testament to ages of neglect. In the dim light, shadows pool like ink, shifting and stretching, whispering secrets long entombed.
