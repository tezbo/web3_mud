The dungeon breathes with an ancient, damp chill, its walls slick with moss and secrets. A low, persistent drip echoes in the distance, each drop a metronome in the silence, while the air is thick with the cloying scent of mildew and rust. Flickering torches cast wavering shadows that dance like phantoms across the rough-hewn stone, their flames hissing softly in protest. Beneath your fingers, the iron bars of the cell are cold and unyielding, a reminder of countless souls that once grasped them in desperation.
