The dungeon yawns open with an oppressive darkness, its walls slick with moisture that clings like a shroud to any who dare tread its depths. The air is thick with the fetid odor of decaying leaves and the coppery tang of rusting chains that clink softly in the unseen breeze. Underfoot, the ground is a patchwork of crumbling stone and treacherous puddles, each step a gamble against unseen hazards. Faint echoes of distant, dripping water create a haunting melody, while shadows shift and dance, concealing secrets best left undisturbed.
