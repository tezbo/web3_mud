In the heart of the Shadowfen dungeon, the air hangs heavy with the damp, earthy scent of decaying leaves and mold. Shadows slink across the stone walls, slick with creeping moisture, their surfaces cold and rough beneath your fingertips. Every footstep echoes ominously, a soft squelch of waterlogged earth beneath leather boots, while distant drips resonate like a ghostly metronome. A bitter tang of rust lingers in the air, mingling with the faint, acrid smell of extinguished torches, casting an oppressive gloom that clings to the skin like an unwanted shroud.
