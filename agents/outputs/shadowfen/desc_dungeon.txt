In the depths of the Shadowfen, the dungeon yawns like a wounded beast, its walls slick with creeping moss that clings like cold, damp fingers. Echoes of distant dripping water resonate through the stifling air, mixing with the distant rattle of unseen chains. A pungent aroma of decay and rust clogs the senses, leaving a metallic tang on the tongue. Flickering torchlight dances across the jagged stone, casting grotesque shadows that twist and writhe as if alive.
