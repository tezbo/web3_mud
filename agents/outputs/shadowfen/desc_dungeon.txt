The dungeon exudes a damp chill, the air thick with the earthy musk of moss and the sharp tang of rusted iron. Faint echoes of dripping water punctuate the oppressive silence, each drop resonating like a distant heartbeat. Shadows writhe against the stone walls, their forms distorted by the flicker of an ancient torch, its flame sputtering in protest. Underfoot, the flagstones are slick with a slick film of moisture, their surfaces worn smooth by centuries of forgotten footsteps.
