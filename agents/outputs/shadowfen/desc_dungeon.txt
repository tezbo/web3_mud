In the heart of the Shadowfen, the dungeon looms like a forgotten relic, its walls slick with moisture and encrusted with creeping moss. The air is thick with the pungent odor of decaying leaves and rusting iron, mingling with a distant, acrid note of something more sinister. Every footstep echoes ominously, the sound swallowed by the perpetual mist that clings to your skin like a damp shroud. Flickering torches cast wavering shadows, their feeble light revealing the glint of chains and the cold, unyielding stone underfoot.
