In the heart of the Shadowfen, the dungeon yawns open like a beast from ancient nightmares, its walls cloaked in a dank tapestry of moss and rusted iron chains. The air is thick with the scent of stagnant water, mingling with the acrid bite of mildew, while the distant drip of unseen moisture echoes against the stone, each drop a reminder of the passage of time. A chill clings to the skin, as if the very stones weep with the memories of those long forgotten. Faint flickers of torchlight cast wavering shadows, dancing like specters across the slick, uneven floor, whispering secrets in a language only the darkness understands.
