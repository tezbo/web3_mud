The air hangs heavy with the cloying scent of damp earth and rusted iron, whispering secrets of ages long forgotten. Shadows cling to the jagged stone walls, their surfaces slick with moisture that glistens faintly in the dim, flickering torchlight. A distant, echoing drip reverberates through the corridors, a haunting metronome that accentuates the oppressive silence. As you brush against the cold, uneven stones, a shiver skates across your skin, the chill seeping into your bones like an unwelcome guest.
