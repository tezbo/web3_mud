In the depths of Shadowfen, the dungeon looms, a labyrinth of cold stone and iron. The air is thick with dampness, carrying a faint, acrid stench of mildew and rust that clings to the walls. The distant drip of water echoes through the corridors, a haunting rhythm underscoring the oppressive silence. Flickering torchlight casts long, quivering shadows, while the chill of the flagstones seeps through boots, numbing toes with every reluctant step.
