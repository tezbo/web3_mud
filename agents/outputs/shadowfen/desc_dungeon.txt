The air hangs thick with the cloying scent of damp earth and rust, a testament to the ancient chains that dangle from stone walls slick with moisture. Shadows twist and writhe in the dim light filtering through narrow, barred windows, their shapes whispering secrets in a language known only to the darkness. Each footfall echoes with a hollow resonance across the uneven flagstones, a reminder of the countless souls who have tread this path before. As you brush against the cold, rough-hewn walls, a chill seeps through your fingertips, leaving a lingering numbness that settles into your bones.
