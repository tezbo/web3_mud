The dungeon breathes with an unsettling dampness, its stone walls slick with a sheen of moisture that clings to your fingers like a cold whisper. Flickering torchlight dances across rust-streaked iron bars, casting jagged shadows that creep along the floor like dark tendrils. The air is heavy with the acrid scent of mildew, mingling with the faint, metallic bite of old blood. Every footstep echoes with a hollow, resonant note, a mournful symphony that underscores the distant drip of unseen water.
