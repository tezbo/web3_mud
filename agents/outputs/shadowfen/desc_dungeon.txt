The dungeon breathes with the chill of the Shadowfen, its walls slick with a sheen of moisture that glistens like tarnished silver in the dim light. Chains clink faintly, their echoes swallowed by the thick, choking mist that clings to your skin like cold, clammy fingers. The air is laced with the sharp, iron scent of rust and the fetid, organic musk of decay, as if the very stone itself were rotting. Underfoot, the ground is uneven, a treacherous tangle of roots and crumbling masonry, each step a whispered threat of betrayal.
