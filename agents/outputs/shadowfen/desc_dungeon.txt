In the suffocating embrace of Shadowfen's dungeon, walls of crumbling stone drip with the sweat of ages, each droplet echoing into the murk. A chill hangs in the air, biting through flesh and settling into bones, while the metallic tang of rust and the fetid stench of stagnant water cling to the senses. The flickering torchlight casts dancing shadows that twist and writhe like forgotten phantoms, their whispering rustle barely audible beneath the distant, mournful howl of the wind. Underfoot, the uneven floor is slick with a film of slime, a treacherous reminder that this place is as alive as it is forgotten.
