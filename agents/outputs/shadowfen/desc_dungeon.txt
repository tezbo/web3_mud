Shadows cling to the damp stone walls of the dungeon like reluctant memories, their surfaces slick with the perpetual seep of moisture. The air hangs heavy with the acrid scent of rusting chains and the fetid staleness of forgotten dreams. A distant, rhythmic drip echoes ominously, each drop splattering onto the cold, uneven floor with a disheartening finality. As you navigate the narrow passage, the chill seeps through your skin, the clammy touch of the mist curling around your ankles like a whisper of lost souls.
