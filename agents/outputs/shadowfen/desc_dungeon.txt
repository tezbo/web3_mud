The dungeon breathes with the damp, cloying chill of the Shadowfen, its stone walls slick with a sheen of moisture that clings stubbornly to the skin. Chains hang from the ceiling like rusted vines, their metallic clatter echoing through the oppressive silence. A musty odor of decaying leaves and stagnant water seeps into every crevice, mingling with the faint, acrid bite of ancient iron. Flickering torches cast wavering shadows that dance across the floor, illuminating the jagged outlines of moss-covered stones underfoot.
