In the stifling embrace of the dungeon, the air clings damply to your skin, a cold, clammy touch that sends shivers down your spine. Shadows writhe along the walls, cast by the flickering dance of a single torch, its flame struggling against the encroaching gloom. The metallic scent of rust mingles with the acrid stench of decaying moss, a testament to years of neglect. Every footstep resounds with a hollow echo against the stone floor, where the slick surface offers a treacherous grip, threatening to betray your every move.
