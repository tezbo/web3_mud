The dungeon yawns like a beast's maw, its walls slick with the sweat of ages. A damp chill clings to the air, curling around you like a serpent, while the earthy musk of decay weaves with the metallic scent of rusted chains. The faint drip of water echoes through the stone corridors, a ghostly rhythm that lulls and unnerves in equal measure. Underfoot, the floor is uneven and cold, each step whispering secrets of those who once traversed these haunted halls. Shadows flicker and dance, playing tricks on the eyes as if the very darkness is alive.
