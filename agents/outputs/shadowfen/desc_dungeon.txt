The dungeon stretches before you, a labyrinth of shadows and whispers, where the walls, slick with moisture, gleam like obsidian under the dim glow of flickering torchlight. A cloying scent of damp earth and rusted iron clings to the air, mingling with the faint, acrid tang of long-burnt smoke. The floor underfoot is uneven and cold, each step echoing with a hollow thud, as if the stones themselves hold secrets of ancient despair. Above, the distant dripping of water provides a haunting rhythm that punctuates the oppressive silence, while the cool, clammy air wraps around you like a shroud.
