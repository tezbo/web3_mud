The dungeon's air clings like damp wool, heavy with the fetid stench of mildew and rusted chains. Faint echoes of dripping water resonate through the stone corridors, each drop a distant whisper of forgotten time. The walls, slick with a cold, clammy moisture, glisten under the dim phosphorescence of moss that weaves like spectral veins across their surface. As you tread cautiously, the ground yields a soft, squelching protest, releasing a metallic tang that lingers in your throat.

Shadows dance erratically across the uneven floor, their flickering shapes cast by the guttering flames of torches ensconced in corroded iron brackets. A distant drip echoes through the corridors, a rhythmic reminder of the world's slow decay, while the taste of earth and time lingers on your tongue.
