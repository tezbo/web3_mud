A shroud of mist clings to the jagged stone walls, their surfaces slick with the perpetual dampness of the Shadowfen. The air is thick with the acrid stench of rusting iron, mingling with the earthy musk of decaying leaves that have somehow found their way inside. The faint echo of dripping water punctuates the oppressive silence, each drop resonating like a ghostly heartbeat. As you brush against the walls, the cold, clammy stone seems to leech the warmth from your fingertips, leaving a lingering chill that seeps into your bones. The ground underfoot is uneven, a treacherous mix of slick moss and loose gravel that crunches softly with each cautious step.
