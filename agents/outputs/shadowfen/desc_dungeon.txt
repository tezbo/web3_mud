The dungeon's air clings to the skin like a damp shroud, heavy with the musk of mold and rusted iron. Shadows writhe along the stone walls, their forms distorted by the flickering torchlight that casts a sickly, ochre glow. The distant drip of water echoes through the corridors, a hollow, rhythmic patter that mingles with the faint skittering of unseen creatures. The floor is slick beneath your boots, a treacherous mix of slime and grit that threatens to unsteady your step.
