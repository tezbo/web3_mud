The air in the Shadowfen dungeon clings heavy and damp, a lingering kiss of moss and rust upon the skin. Dim light filters through the iron-barred windows, casting skeletal shadows that dance across the stone walls slick with mildew. A low, constant drip echoes through the chamber, each drop sending tremors through the ground like a heartbeat. The metallic scent of old blood hangs in the air, mingling with the earthy stench of decay, a reminder of the dungeon's forgotten captives.
