The dungeon sprawls out in a labyrinthine weave of damp stone and creeping shadows, the walls slick with a persistent sheen of moisture. The air is thick with the cloying scent of decay, mingling with the metallic bite of rusting iron chains that sway gently with an unseen draft. Each footfall echoes like a distant whisper, the sound swallowed by the oppressive gloom that clings to the skin like a cold, clammy shroud. A chill seeps through the soles of your boots, as if the very ground beneath is alive, murmuring secrets of ages past.
