The dungeon of Shadowfen is a claustrophobic warren of dank stone tunnels, where the walls ooze with a persistent, clammy moisture. A fetid scent of mildew and decay hangs heavily in the air, mingling with the sharp, metallic tang of rusted chains that rattle softly whenever a draft whispers through the corridors. The flickering torchlight casts twisted shadows that dance upon the slick, uneven floor, while the distant drip of water echoes like a ghostly heartbeat. Each step you take is met with the gritty texture of damp, crumbling earth underfoot, as if the very ground seeks to swallow you whole.
