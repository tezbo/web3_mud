The dungeon crouches beneath the earth like a forgotten beast, its stone walls slick with the touch of perpetual dampness. A chill mist coils languidly around your ankles, carrying the acrid scent of rust and decay. Faint echoes of water droplets form a haunting melody, reverberating off the cold, iron-barred cells. The air is thick and heavy, tasting of moss and the long-held secrets of the Shadowfen, leaving an unsettling residue on your tongue.
