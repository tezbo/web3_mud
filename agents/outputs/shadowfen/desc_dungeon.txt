The air hangs heavy with the cloying scent of damp earth and rusted iron, weaving through the labyrinthine corridors like a persistent ghost. Shadows writhe across the cracked stone walls, their dance accompanied by the distant drip of water echoing through the silence. Underfoot, the slick floor is cold and unyielding, its surface pocked with treacherous patches of moss that threaten to steal your footing. A chilling draft snakes through the passage, brushing like icy fingers against your skin, promising secrets and forgotten whispers in the oppressive gloom.
