In the heart of Shadowfen's dungeon, shadows cling to the damp stone walls like ancient memories refusing to fade. The air is thick, laden with the acrid scent of mildew and rust, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of old blood. Every footfall echoes ominously, reverberating through the cold, clammy corridors, while distant drips of water punctuate the silence like a metronome marking time in this forgotten underworld. Your fingers brush against the slick, uneven surface of the walls, the chill seeping through your skin as if the dungeon itself is trying to pull you into its eternal embrace.
