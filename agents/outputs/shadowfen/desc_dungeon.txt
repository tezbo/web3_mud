The dungeon walls are slick with a clammy dew that clings to your skin like a cold whisper, the stones dark and moss-eaten where the light fails to reach. The air is thick with the acrid stench of rust and decay, a relentless assault on your senses that lingers in your throat. Each footfall echoes eerily, swallowed by the labyrinthine passages, while distant drips of water punctuate the heavy silence like a mournful dirge. A faint, metallic tang laces the air, mingling with the dampness to leave a bitter taste on your lips, as shadows dance malevolently along the corridors, cast by flickering torches that fight against the encroaching gloom.
