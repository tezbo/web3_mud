The dungeon yawns open like a maw of shadow, its walls slick with a perpetual sheen of moisture that glistens under the feeble glow of moss-covered lanterns. The air is dense, filled with the earthy musk of damp stone and the faint, acrid bite of rusting chains that clink softly in the unseen corners. Each footstep echoes hollowly, betraying the presence of unseen depths below, where the chill of the flagstones seeps through the soles of your boots, numbing your feet. A draft whispers through the corridors, carrying with it a fleeting taste of decay, a reminder of those who once wandered here and never returned.
