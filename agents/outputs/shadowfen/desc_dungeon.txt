In the heart of the Shadowfen, the dungeon sprawls like a forgotten wound beneath the earth, its stone walls slick with the eternal kiss of mist. The air is thick and stagnant, carrying the acrid scent of rust and decay, mingled with a faint hint of something sulfurous. Each footstep echoes with a hollow dread, the sound swallowed by the oppressive darkness that presses close, like a damp, weighty shroud. The walls seem to whisper secrets in a language of scraping metal and distant, mournful drips, while the chill seeps into your bones, leaving a clammy residue on your skin.
