The dungeon's air hangs heavy with the scent of damp stone and rusted iron, a murky blend that clings to the back of your throat. Flickering torchlight dances across walls slick with moisture, casting wavering shadows that seem to slither and coil like living things. The distant drip of water echoes through the corridors, a rhythmic whisper against the oppressive silence. As your fingers brush the rough-hewn walls, they pick up the cold, gritty residue of ages past, a chilling reminder of the dungeon’s forgotten, forlorn history.
