The dungeon yawns like the maw of some ancient beast, its stone walls slick with the ever-present caress of mist. Chains clink softly in the gloom, each reverberation a ghostly whisper against the silence. The air is thick with the pungent odor of decay, tinged with the acrid bite of iron. As your fingers brush the cold, damp stone, a shiver races up your spine, its chill as sharp as the rusted bars that cage the shadows.
