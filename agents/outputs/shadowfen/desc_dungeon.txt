In the heart of the Shadowfen, the dungeon breathes with the damp chill of ancient secrets. Shadows cling to the rusted iron bars, their edges softened by the perpetual mist that seeps through cracks in the stone walls. The air is thick with the musty scent of decay, laced with the faint, acrid tang of mildew. Each footstep echoes with a hollow resonance, the sound swallowed by the heavy silence that presses like a shroud. As your fingers graze the slick, cold stones, a shiver races up your spine, and the metallic taste of fear lingers on your tongue.
