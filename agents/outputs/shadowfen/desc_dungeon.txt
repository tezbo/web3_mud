The dungeon yawns like a ravenous maw, its stone walls slick with creeping tendrils of moss that glisten in the dim, flickering torchlight. The air is thick and fetid, carrying the sour stench of decay and the sharp bite of rusting iron bars that imprison shadows, whispering secrets in the damp. Every step echoes ominously, the crunch of gravel underfoot mingling with the distant drip of water, creating a symphony of forlorn despair. A chill licks at your skin, seeping through the tattered remnants of past prisoners’ dreams, leaving a bitter tang of hopelessness on your tongue.
