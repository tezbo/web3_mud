The dungeon yawns like a forgotten maw, its stone walls slick with a perpetual sheen of moisture that seeps from the earth. Shadows cling thick and heavy, whispering secrets in the creak of rusted chains that dangle from the ceiling like spectral fingers. The air is a heady mix of damp earth and the sharp, acrid bite of iron, a scent that clings to the back of your throat. Underfoot, the ground is uneven, the cold, rough-hewn stones pressing against your soles with each careful step, as if the dungeon itself were testing your resolve.
