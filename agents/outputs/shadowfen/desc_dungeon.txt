The dungeon breathes with an ancient, unsettling chill, its stone walls slick with creeping moss that glistens like wet emeralds in the dim light. The air is thick with the acrid tang of rusting iron and the fetid musk of stagnant water pooling in uneven stone grooves. Chains clatter softly from unseen recesses, a ghostly symphony echoing through the cavernous gloom. As you brush against the walls, a damp, gritty residue clings to your fingertips, a tactile reminder of the dungeon's unyielding embrace.
