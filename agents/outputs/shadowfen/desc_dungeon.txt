In the depths of Shadowfen's dungeon, the air hangs thick with the musty scent of damp earth and rusted iron, mingling with the faint acrid bite of mold. Shadows cling to the stone walls like ancient memories, their surfaces slick and cold to the touch, whispering secrets in the language of condensation. The distant drip of water echoes like a mournful heartbeat, punctuating the oppressive silence that envelops the labyrinthine corridors. Flickering torches cast feeble pools of light, their flames sputtering as if starved for air, while the taste of stale fear lingers on the tongue, sour and metallic.
