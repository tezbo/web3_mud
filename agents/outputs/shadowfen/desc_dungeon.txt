The dungeon of Shadowfen is a symphony of decay, where rusted iron bars weep with moisture that drips onto the slick stone floor. A musty odor hangs heavy in the air, mingling with the acrid stench of mildew, as if the very walls exhale the essence of forgotten despair. The dim torchlight flickers feebly, barely piercing the thick, cloying mist that clings to every surface, its tendrils cold and clammy against your skin. In the oppressive silence, the distant echo of a water droplet striking a puddle reverberates like a heartbeat, a reminder of time slipping away in this forgotten place.
