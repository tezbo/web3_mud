Ambient Messages:
1. The distant drip of water echoes through the damp, stone corridors, while the air hangs thick with the musty scent of ancient decay and forgotten secrets. 

2. Flickering torchlight dances across rough-hewn walls, casting long shadows that seem to writhe and pulse with the whisper of unseen horrors lurking just beyond sight. 

3. A chilling draft snakes through the narrow passage, carrying with it the faint metallic tang of blood and the soft, unsettling rustle of something scuttling in the darkness.
