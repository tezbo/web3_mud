In the heart of the Shadowfen, the dungeon breathes with a damp, oppressive chill that clings to your skin like a second layer. The air is thick with the scent of mildew and rust, an acrid undertone that stings the nostrils. Faint echoes of dripping water reverberate through the stone corridors, a ghostly symphony of solitude. The walls, slick with moisture, glisten under the flickering torchlight, casting eerie shadows that dance across the floor, whispering secrets of those long forgotten.
