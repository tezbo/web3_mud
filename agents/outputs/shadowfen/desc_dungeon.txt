In the heart of the Shadowfen, the dungeon sprawls like a forgotten warren, its walls slick with a perpetual sheen of moisture that clings to the skin like a cold whisper. The air is thick with the scent of wet stone and the faint, acrid bite of rusted iron, mingling with the earthy musk of decay. Each footstep echoes ominously, a hollow sound swallowed by the oppressive darkness that presses in from all sides. The faintest glimmer of torchlight flickers across the surface of stagnant pools, casting warped reflections that dance like phantoms in the gloom.
