The dungeon crouches beneath the earth like a forgotten beast, its stone walls slick with the touch of perpetual dampness. A chill mist coils languidly around your ankles, carrying the acrid scent of rust and decay. Faint echoes of water droplets form a haunting melody, reverberating off the cold, iron-barred cells. The air is thick and heavy, tasting of moss and the long-held secrets of the Shadowfen, leaving an unsettling residue on your tongue.

The dungeon yawns open like a maw of shadow, its walls slick with a perpetual sheen of moisture that glistens under the feeble glow of moss-covered lanterns. The air is dense, filled with the earthy musk of damp stone and the faint, acrid bite of rusting chains that clink softly in the unseen corners. Each footstep echoes hollowly, betraying the presence of unseen depths below, where the chill of the flagstones seeps through the soles of your boots, numbing your feet. A draft whispers through the corridors, carrying with it a fleeting taste of decay, a reminder of those who once wandered here and never returned.
