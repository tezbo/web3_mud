The dungeon breathes with a damp, cold chill that clings to your skin like icy fingers. In the murky gloom, the walls glisten with a slick sheen of moisture, the stone veined with creeping tendrils of moss that whisper against your touch. The air is thick with the sour stench of decay, punctuated by the faint, metallic tang of rusting chains that clatter softly in the distance. Every footstep echoes ominously, a hollow sound swallowed by the shadows lurking in every corner.
