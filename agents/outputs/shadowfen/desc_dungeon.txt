The dungeon lies shrouded in a perpetual haze, where tendrils of mist coil around rusted iron bars, whispering secrets to the shadows. A damp chill seeps through the stone walls, slick with moss and the weight of countless years, pressing like a cold hand against your skin. The air carries a fetid stench of decay, mingling with the acrid scent of ancient iron, as distant echoes of dripping water punctuate the oppressive silence. Each step on the uneven, grit-covered floor sends a shiver through your bones, as if the ground itself remembers the sorrows of those long vanished.
