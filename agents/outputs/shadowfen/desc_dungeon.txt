In the heart of the Shadowfen, the dungeon lies shrouded in a perpetual twilight, where the air hangs heavy with the acrid stench of damp earth and rusted iron. Shadows twist and writhe across the stone walls, their surfaces slick with a thin film of moisture that chills the fingers and sends shivers racing up the spine. The distant drip of water echoes like a ghostly heartbeat, punctuated by the unsettling scuttle of unseen creatures skirting the edges of perception. A faint taste of decay lingers in the air, as if the very essence of the place has seeped into every crevice, leaving a haunting imprint on the senses.
