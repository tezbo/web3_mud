The dungeon lies cloaked in perpetual twilight, where damp stone walls glisten with a sheen of moisture, their surface gritty beneath your fingertips. A low, persistent drip echoes hauntingly, each drop resonating through the silence like a heartbeat in the stillness. The air is thick with the earthy scent of moss, mingling with the acrid tang of rusted iron bars that encase the cells. Underfoot, the ground is cold and uneven, the chill seeping through the soles of your boots as if the very shadows seek to entwine themselves around you.
