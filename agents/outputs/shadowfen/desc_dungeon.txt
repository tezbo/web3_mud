The dungeon breathes with the damp, cloying air of the Shadowfen, its walls slick with creeping tendrils of moss and rust. A low, persistent drip echoes from unseen corners, each splash a metronome of despair in the oppressive silence. The smell of decaying vegetation mingles with the sharp, metallic bite of old iron shackles, creating a pungent symphony that clings to the back of the throat. Cold drafts skitter across the stone floor, brushing against skin like the whisper of forgotten ghosts, leaving a lingering chill that sinks into bones.
