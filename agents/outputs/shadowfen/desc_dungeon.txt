The air in the dungeon hangs heavy with the cloying scent of damp earth and the acrid sting of rust. Shadows drip from the ceiling like ink, pooling in the jagged cracks of the stone walls, while the distant drip of water echoes eerily through the corridors. The rough-hewn floor is slick underfoot, a treacherous blend of mud and moss that clings to the soles like a persistent whisper. Lanterns, their light flickering feebly against the encroaching gloom, cast fleeting, distorted silhouettes that dance along the walls like restless phantoms.
