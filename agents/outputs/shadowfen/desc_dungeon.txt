In the heart of the Shadowfen, the dungeon yawns open like a forgotten maw, its stone walls slick with a sheen of perpetual dampness. The air is thick with the acrid stench of mildew and rust, a testament to the years of neglect and decay. Water drips incessantly from the ceiling, each droplet echoing through the labyrinthine corridors like a whispered secret. The ground underfoot is uneven, the stones shifting slightly with each step, their chill seeping into your bones as your fingers brush against the rough, moss-covered walls. A distant, hollow clang resounds periodically, a haunting reminder of unseen depths and the secrets they might conceal.
