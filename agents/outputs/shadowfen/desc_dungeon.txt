In the heart of Shadowfen's labyrinthine depths, the dungeon walls weep with rivulets of moisture, their surface a tapestry of moss and rust that seems to swallow the feeble light. The air hangs heavy, a choking miasma of mildew and decay, while the distant drip of water echoes like a forgotten lament. Chains, cold and clammy to the touch, dangle from the ceiling, their clinking a ghostly whisper. The taste of iron lingers on the tongue, mingling with the bitter tang of despair that permeates the gloom.
