The dungeon sprawls beneath the earth like a forgotten maw, its walls slick with moisture and veined with creeping rust. A faint, mournful drip echoes through the oppressive silence, each drop a metronome counting down to despair. The air is thick with the stench of mildew and old iron, clinging to the back of the throat like a slow poison. Shadows pool in corners, shifting with a life of their own, while the cold stone floors bite through thin-soled boots, infusing the marrow with an unforgiving chill.
