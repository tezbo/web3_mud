The dungeon yawned beneath the earth, its stone walls slick with moss and the ghostly touch of cold mist. Chains clink softly in the murk, a metallic whisper that echoes through the labyrinthine corridors. The air is thick with the musty scent of decay, mingling with the sharp, acrid bite of rust. Each step across the uneven, damp floor sends a shiver up your spine, as if the shadows themselves hold secrets they long to share.
