The dungeon walls, slick with the perspiration of eternal damp, glisten faintly in the murky torchlight, their surfaces etched with the patina of rust and moss. A faint, oppressive melody of dripping water echoes through the narrow corridors, punctuated by the distant skitter of unseen creatures. The air is thick with the musty scent of earth and decay, mingling with a metallic tang that clings to the back of your throat. As you tread cautiously on the uneven ground, the cold stones beneath your feet seem to whisper secrets of forgotten despair.
