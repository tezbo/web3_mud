The dungeon yawns open like a maw, its stone walls slick with the permanent kiss of dampness, exuding the earthy scent of moss and mildew. Chains clink faintly in the shadows, their metallic whispers echoing against the hollow, oppressive silence that hangs heavy in the air. Faint shafts of moonlight filter through iron-barred windows, casting ghostly patterns on the floor, where cold rivulets of water snake through the rusted grates. The chill bites through to the bone, leaving a metallic tang on the tongue and a sense of foreboding that clings to the skin like a shroud.
