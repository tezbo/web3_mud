The dungeon is a labyrinthine maw carved from ancient stone, its walls slick with the perspiration of the earth. A faint, acrid stench of rusted iron permeates the air, mingling with the musty breath of decay. Each footfall echoes with a hollow dread, reverberating through the narrow corridors like a whispering specter. The chill of the damp air clings to the skin, seeping through fabric to settle in the bones, while distant drops of water punctuate the oppressive silence with a rhythmic, mournful drip.
