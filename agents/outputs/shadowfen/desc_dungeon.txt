In the shadowed recesses of the Shadowfen dungeon, the air is thick with the scent of damp earth and corroding metal, a testament to its age. Flickering torchlight dances across walls slick with moisture, casting fleeting specters onto the rusted iron bars that groan in protest with the slightest draft. A steady drip echoes through the chamber, resonating like a somber heartbeat, punctuated by the distant scuttle of unseen creatures. As you step forward, the cold stone floor is slick beneath your feet, sending a shiver through your bones, as if the very dungeon clings to the warmth it has long been denied.
