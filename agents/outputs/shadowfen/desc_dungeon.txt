The dungeon of Shadowfen lies shrouded in perpetual gloom, its walls slick with a patina of rust and mildew. Chains clink softly in the shadows, their metallic whispers echoing eerily through the dank, narrow corridors. A musty odor of decay clings to the air, mingling with the acrid scent of damp stone. Underfoot, the ground is uneven and treacherous, the cold grit of ancient dirt crunching beneath every cautious step.
