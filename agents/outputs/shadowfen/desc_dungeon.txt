The dungeon sprawls beneath the earth like a forgotten serpent, its rusted iron bars and chains clinging to the damp stone walls. A thick, oppressive mist coils at your ankles, carrying the bitter scent of mildew and decay, mingled with the faintest hint of something acrid and metallic. The only sound is the distant, rhythmic drip of water echoing through the corridors, a haunting lullaby that reverberates in the hollow chambers. As you run your fingers along the gritty, moisture-laden walls, a chill seeps into your bones, a whisper of forgotten anguish from those who lingered here long before.
