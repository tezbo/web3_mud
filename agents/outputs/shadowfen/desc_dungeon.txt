The dungeon looms with the oppressive weight of age, its stone walls slick with the eternal embrace of creeping moss and moisture. Faint echoes of dripping water punctuate the thick, suffocating silence, each droplet a metronome ticking away in the gloom. A rancid odor of decay lingers, mingled with the sharp tang of iron, hinting at long-forgotten tales of suffering. The chill in the air is palpable, a damp, clammy mist that clutches at your skin and seeps into your very bones, leaving an unsettling chill in its wake.
