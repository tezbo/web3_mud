In the depths of Shadowfen, the dungeon yawns open like a forgotten maw, its stone walls slick with a film of moss and moisture that chills the fingertips. The air is heavy with the pungent decay of rotting wood and damp earth, mingling with an acrid hint of rust from the ancient chains that clink softly in the stillness. Shadows pool in corners where the feeble glow of phosphorescent fungi fails to reach, casting an eerie, flickering dance of light and dark. The silence is punctuated by the distant, rhythmic drip of water echoing through the labyrinthine corridors, creating a haunting melody that reverberates through the hollow, echoing chambers.
