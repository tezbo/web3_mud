The air hangs heavy in the dungeon, a cloying blend of mildew and rust that clings to your skin like a damp shroud. Flickering torchlight casts erratic shadows on the stone walls, their surfaces slick with the relentless seep of groundwater. Each step echoes with a hollow, ominous resonance, the sound swallowed by the oppressive silence. The tang of iron and decay lingers on your tongue, as if the stones themselves exhale the remnants of forgotten prisoners.
