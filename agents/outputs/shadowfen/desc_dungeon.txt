In the dim heart of the Shadowfen dungeon, the air hangs thick with the acrid bite of mildew and the faint, metallic whisper of rusted chains swaying gently. Flickering torchlight dances across the walls, casting wavering shadows that writhe like specters seeking escape. Your fingers brush against the slick, cold stone, rough with age and dampness seeping from the earth below. Every step is accompanied by the muffled squelch of waterlogged moss underfoot, releasing a sour, earthy scent that clings to the air like a mournful memory.
