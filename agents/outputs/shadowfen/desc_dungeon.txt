The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the iron bite of rust, clinging to the crumbling stone walls like the tendrils of a forgotten curse. Stalactites drip with a steady rhythm, their droplets splashing into shadowy pools that mirror the dim glow of phosphorescent fungi clinging to the ceiling. A distant clank echoes through the winding corridors, a metallic whisper that raises the fine hairs along your arms. The ground underfoot is slick with moss, each step a cautious dance over the cold, uneven stones.
