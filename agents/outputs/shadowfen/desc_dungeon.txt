In the murky depths of the Shadowfen dungeon, the air clings to your skin like a damp shroud, heavy with the scent of moss and rusted iron. Flickering torchlight dances across the slick stone walls, casting long shadows that skitter and writhe like ancient phantoms. Each step echoes with a hollow resonance, the sound swallowed quickly by the oppressive silence that fills the space between drips of water from the ceiling. The taste of stale, stagnant air lingers at the back of your throat, as the chill seeps into your bones, drawing a shiver from your soul.
