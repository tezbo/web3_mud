The dungeon yawns before you, its stone walls slick with a perpetual sheen of dampness that clings to your skin like a cold shroud. The air is thick with the pungent aroma of mildew and something darker, a metallic tang that tickles the back of your throat. Every footfall echoes in the oppressive silence, disturbed only by the distant drip of water, each drop hitting the floor with a hollow, mocking resonance. Dim light filters through the rusted iron bars of a high, narrow window, casting skeletal shadows that dance eerily along the uneven flagstones.
