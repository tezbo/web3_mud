The dungeon breathes with a damp, earthy chill, its stone walls slick with moisture and veined with creeping tendrils of moss. Shadows pool in the corners, shifting like restless phantoms as the dim light from flickering torches dances across rusted iron bars. The air is thick with the musty odor of decay, mingled with the faint, coppery scent of old blood and the acrid tang of mold. Each step echoes hollowly, the sound swallowed by the oppressive silence, while the gritty floor underfoot offers a cold, unyielding embrace.
