In the heart of the Shadowfen, the dungeon sprawls like a beast of stone and iron, its walls slick with a cold sweat of condensation. The air hums with a low, mournful wail, as if the very stones lament the secrets they cradle. A damp, earthy musk mingles with the acrid bite of rust, coiling in your nostrils and settling on your tongue like a bitter aftertaste. Each step echoes dully against the ancient flagstones, the chill seeping through your boots and gnawing at your bones, as faint, ghostly whispers brush against your skin like a half-forgotten memory.
