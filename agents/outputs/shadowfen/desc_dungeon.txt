In the heart of the Shadowfen, the dungeon breathes with an unsettling life of its own. The air is thick and damp, clinging to skin like a shroud, carrying the acrid smell of rust and decay that lingers in every inhalation. Flickering torchlight casts long, wavering shadows across the slick, moss-covered stone walls, their surfaces cold and unforgiving beneath your fingers. The distant drip of water echoes ominously, a slow, rhythmic reminder of time's relentless passage, while the metallic taste of iron lingers on your tongue.
