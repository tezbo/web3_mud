The dungeon breathes with the thick, cloying mist of Shadowfen, its air steeped in the scent of damp earth and rusted iron. Shadows stretch and shiver across cold stone walls, the flickering torchlight casting a dance of sinister shapes that seem alive. Water drips steadily from the ceiling, each droplet landing with a hollow echo that reverberates through the gloom. Rough-hewn chains hang from the walls, their chill metal biting against the skin like the breath of forgotten specters.
