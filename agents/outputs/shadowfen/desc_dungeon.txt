The dungeon lies shrouded in a murky gloom, where tendrils of mist coil like serpents around rusted bars and crumbling stone. A damp chill clings to the skin, the air saturated with the sour odor of mold and decay. Every step echoes with a hollow resonance, disturbed only by the distant drip of water falling from the jagged ceiling. The walls, slick with an age-old grime, offer an unwelcome touch, leaving fingers cold and damp. Shadows flit at the edge of vision, teasing the senses with whispers that seem to rise from the very ground.
