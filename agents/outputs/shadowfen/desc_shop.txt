The shop is a dim sanctuary of whispered secrets and forgotten things, where shelves bow under the weight of tarnished artifacts and peculiar trinkets. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth, mingled with a faint, sweet decay that clings like a second skin. The floorboards creak softly underfoot, their groans echoing through the room like cautious murmurs. In the low light, shadows slither across the walls, caressing the rusted edges of ancient tools and the faded spines of leather-bound tomes.
