The shop in Shadowfen is a dim, cluttered haven where the air hangs heavy with the scent of aged parchment and musty leather. Shelves carved from ancient, gnarled wood groan under the weight of curious trinkets, their surfaces slick with a fine layer of swamp mist. As you step inside, the floorboards creak softly, their groans swallowed by the rustling whispers of wind slipping through the cracks. A pale, eerie glow from phosphorescent fungi casts flickering shadows, revealing glimpses of tarnished silver and the gleam of glass vials filled with thick, mysterious liquids.
