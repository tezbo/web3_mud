The shop crouches beneath a veil of perpetual mist, its wooden beams warped and slick with age, exuding a faint musk of moss and damp earth. Inside, the air is thick with the acrid scent of tanned leather and the sharper tang of rusted iron. Shelves sag under the weight of peculiar trinkets, their surfaces cold and gritty to the touch, whispering stories of forgotten trades. Each footstep is swallowed by the soft creak of the floorboards, their voices echoing like distant memories in the dim, flickering lamplight.
