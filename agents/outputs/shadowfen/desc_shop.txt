The shop breathes with the damp musk of aged leather and the faint, earthy scent of moss clinging to the stones. Shadows pool in every corner, cast by flickering lanterns that hang like spectral fireflies from the ceiling, their light glinting off rusted metal trinkets cluttered on shelves. The floor beneath your feet is cool and uneven, slick with a fine sheen of mist that permeates the air. A whispering breeze seeps through a cracked window, carrying with it the distant croak of unseen frogs, harmonizing with the soft rustle of silk drapes that partition the dimly lit room.
