The shop's interior is cloaked in a dim, green-tinged light that filters through the moss-veiled windows, casting intricate patterns on the rusted iron shelves. The air is thick with the earthy aroma of damp earth and decaying leaves, mingling with the sharp, metallic scent of old coins. Beneath your feet, the wooden floorboards creak softly, their surfaces slick with the persistent mist that clings to everything in the Shadowfen. A faint, rhythmic drumming echoes from the back, where rainwater drips from the thatched eaves into a collection of cracked ceramic bowls.
