The shop's dim interior is cloaked in a tapestry of shadows, where the air hangs thick with the musty aroma of aged parchment and damp earth. Shelves, encrusted with rust, groan beneath the weight of forgotten curiosities and tarnished relics that glint dully in the gloom. A soft patter of rain against the warped windowpanes underscores the hushed whispers of the proprietor, his voice as smooth and slippery as the mist that coils around the doorframe. Your fingers graze the cool, slick surface of a jade trinket, its chill seeping into your skin like the touch of the fen's own secrets.
