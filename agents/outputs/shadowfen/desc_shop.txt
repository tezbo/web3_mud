The shop clings to the edge of the Shadowfen like a secret whispered in the dark. Its walls are cloaked in creeping vines, their leaves glistening with the damp mist that hangs heavy in the air. Inside, the scent of aged leather and musty parchment mingles with the earthy aroma of moss. Shelves sag under the weight of rusting trinkets, each artifact cold and slick to the touch, whispering tales of forgotten times. The soft drip of water from the ceiling punctuates the silence, a rhythm as timeless as the shadows themselves.
