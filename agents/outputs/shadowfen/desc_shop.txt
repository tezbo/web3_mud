The shop crouches low beneath a tangle of ancient willow branches, their long fingers weaving through the damp air like spectral guardians. Inside, the air carries a musty blend of decaying parchment and moss, whispering secrets with every creak of the warped wooden floor. Flickering lanterns cast erratic shadows across shelves cluttered with peculiar artifacts, each coated in a fine layer of dust that clings to the fingers like a ghostly residue. The distant drip of water echoes through the dim space, a rhythmic pulse that speaks of unseen depths below.
