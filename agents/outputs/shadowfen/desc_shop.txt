In the dimly lit shop, flickering lanterns cast long shadows that dance across the rusted shelves, their surfaces slick with the perpetual damp of the Shadowfen. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth mingled with the sharp, sour tang of mildew and something sweetly rotten, like overripe fruit. Beneath your feet, the wooden floorboards creak softly, their grain swollen and warped by years of mists that seep through every crack and crevice. The quiet murmur of the outside swamp is punctuated by the occasional drip of water, a persistent rhythm that lulls and unnerves in equal measure.
