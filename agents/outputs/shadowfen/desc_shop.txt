The shop is a dim haven amidst the swirling mists of Shadowfen, its walls adorned with rusted trinkets that whisper secrets of a forgotten age. The air is thick with the musty scent of damp earth and the faint, acrid bite of iron, mingling with the herbal undertones of dried fenroot hanging in bunches from the ceiling. The floorboards creak softly underfoot, their grain worn smooth like river stones, while the occasional drip of condensation echoes from the rafters. A lantern flickers, casting erratic shadows that dance across shelves brimming with peculiar wares: jars of viscous, dark liquid and bundles of sinewy roots bound with twine.
