In the dim, flickering light of the Shadowfen shop, shelves bow under the weight of peculiar trinkets and ancient tomes, their covers etched with faded runes. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and a hint of something metallic, like rusted iron left too long in the mist. Each footfall is muffled by a thick, tattered rug that obscures the creaking wooden floor beneath. A distant drip echoes from somewhere unseen, a rhythmic counterpoint to the barely audible whispers that seem to emanate from the very walls.
