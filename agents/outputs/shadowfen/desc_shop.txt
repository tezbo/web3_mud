The shop's narrow entrance is veiled by tendrils of mist, seeping through the doorframe and curling around the uneven floorboards like ghostly fingers. Lanterns with rusting iron frames cast an eerie, flickering glow that dances across shelves of tarnished curiosities and ancient, weathered tomes. The air is thick with the pungent aroma of damp earth and moss, undercut by the sharp, metallic scent of old coins. Each step you take is accompanied by the creak of aged wood, the chill of the floor seeping through your soles as if the ground itself whispers secrets long forgotten.
