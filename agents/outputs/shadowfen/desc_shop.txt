The shop crouches in the gloom, its wooden shelves warped and twisted like ancient tree roots. A damp chill clings to the air, the musk of decaying leaves mingling with the acrid bite of rusted iron. The faint drip of water echoes from hidden corners, a slow, rhythmic patter that mingles with the soft whisper of cobwebs brushing against skin. Flickering lanterns cast a sickly glow, their light dancing eerily over tarnished trinkets and shadowy alcoves.
