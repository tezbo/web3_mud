The shop nestles within a hollow of gnarled trees, their twisted roots forming archways that beckon with shadowy promise. Inside, the air hangs heavy with the earthy scent of damp moss and the sharp, tangy hint of rusted metal. Shelves carved from dark, slick wood creak under the weight of peculiar trinkets, each glistening with a sheen of dew. The soft patter of rainfall on the roof creates a rhythmic lullaby, while the occasional drip finds its way inside, leaving cool, fleeting kisses on the stone floor.
