The shop huddles beneath a tangle of ancient trees, their gnarled branches dripping with moisture that patters softly on the mossy roof. Inside, the air is thick with the pungent aroma of dried herbs and the faint, coppery scent of rusting iron, mingling with the earthy musk of decaying leaves. Shelves carved from dark, waterlogged wood creak beneath the weight of glass jars filled with strange, luminescent fungi and grotesque, pickled specimens. A dim, flickering lantern casts wavering shadows across the uneven floor, where your boots sink slightly into the spongy, damp planks.
