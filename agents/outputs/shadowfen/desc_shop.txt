The dimly lit shop is cloaked in shadows, where the air hangs heavy with the earthy scent of damp moss and decayed leaves. Shelves, slick with mildew, groan under the weight of rusted trinkets and tarnished relics that glint dully in the flickering candlelight, casting elongated, dancing shadows across the stone floor. The faint drip of moisture echoes in the stillness, and a chill seeps through the soles of your boots as you tread upon the uneven flagstones, each step resonating with a muffled thud. Whispers of a distant wind slip through the cracks in the walls, carrying with them the metallic tang of the fog that perpetually blankets the Shadowfen.
