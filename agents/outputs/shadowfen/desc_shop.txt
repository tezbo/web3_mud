The shop huddles beneath a canopy of gnarled branches, their twisted fingers casting fractured shadows across the threshold. Inside, the air is thick with the earthy aroma of damp moss and the sharp tang of rust, mingling with a faint, sweet undertone of decaying wood. Shelves creak ominously under the weight of peculiar trinkets, their surfaces slick with a sheen of condensation that clings to your fingertips like a cold whisper. The only sound is the soft drip of water from a leaky roof, a steady beat that echoes through the dim, mist-laden space.
