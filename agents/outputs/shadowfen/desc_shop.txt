The shop is a dim sanctuary nestled within the Shadowfen, cloaked in rivulets of mist that seep through the cracked wooden planks. Shelves laden with tarnished trinkets and rusted curiosities exude a metallic musk, mingling with the earthy scent of damp moss clinging to the walls. The gentle creak of the floorboards underfoot accompanies the distant drip of water, echoing from unseen corners. Your fingers brush against gnarled wood, its surface cool and slick, whispering tales of forgotten ages and shadowed secrets.
