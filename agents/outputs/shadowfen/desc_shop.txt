In the dim recesses of the Shadowfen, the shop stands like a forgotten relic, its exterior draped in creeping ivy and patches of lichen. As you step inside, the air is thick with the musky scent of damp earth and aged leather, mingling with the sharp tang of rusted iron. Shelves creak under the weight of peculiar trinkets, their surfaces cool and slick to the touch, like stones fished from a stream. The whispered crackle of an unseen fire adds a haunting melody, echoing off walls adorned with shadows that dance like ghosts in the flickering light.
