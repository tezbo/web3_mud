In the dim, flickering light of the shop's lone oil lamp, shelves sag under the weight of peculiar artifacts cloaked in dust and time. The air is thick with the cloying scent of damp earth and aged leather, mingling with a faint undercurrent of rusted metal. Every step on the warped wooden floorboards elicits a muffled creak, echoing like a whispered secret in the stillness. Your fingers brush against the cool, slick surface of a jade talisman, its edges sharp against your skin, promising mystery and forgotten tales.
