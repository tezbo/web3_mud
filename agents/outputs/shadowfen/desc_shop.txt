In the dim light of the Shadowfen shop, shelves made of ancient, gnarled wood groan under the weight of peculiar trinkets and eldritch tomes. A thin veil of mist coils lazily around your ankles, its chill clinging to your skin like a forgotten whisper. The air is thick with the musk of damp earth and a faint, acrid scent of rusting metal, mingling with the sweet decay of herbs hanging in bundles from the ceiling. Beneath the quiet murmur of a far-off swamp, you can hear the delicate clink of jade wind chimes, their melody a haunting echo through the gloom.
