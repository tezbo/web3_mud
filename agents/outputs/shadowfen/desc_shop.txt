In the dim confines of the Shadowfen shop, the air is thick with the earthy scent of moss and the acrid bite of rust. Shelves fashioned from gnarled roots creak under the weight of peculiar wares, each item cloaked in a patina of swamp mist. The soft murmur of the bog outside seeps through the walls, mingling with the muted clink of glass vials as they sway gently in their hanging nests. A chill clings to the air, wrapping around you like a damp cloak, while your fingers brush against the slick, cold surface of a jade amulet, its surface etched with runes that seem to whisper secrets from long-forgotten times.
