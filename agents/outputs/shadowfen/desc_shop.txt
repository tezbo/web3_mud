In the dimly lit shop of Shadowfen, the walls glisten with a sheen of perpetually clinging mist, their surface mottled with patches of pale lichen. A symphony of soft creaks accompanies your steps as the ancient wooden floorboards shift beneath your weight. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint, acrid bite of rusting metal, mingling with the sweet decay of forest loam. Shelves stagger under the weight of peculiar trinkets, their surfaces cold and slick to the touch, each object whispering secrets from forgotten times.
