The shop crouches at the edge of the mist-shrouded street, its wooden facade marred by creeping vines of rust-orange moss. Inside, the air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the sharp, metallic bite of old iron; the floorboards creak underfoot, each step releasing a whisper of dust that tickles the nose. Shelves groan beneath the weight of peculiar trinkets and tarnished relics, their surfaces cool and slick to the touch, as if perpetually weeping the moisture of the fen. From the back, the soft clinking of glass jars creates a rhythmic counterpoint to the distant croak of unseen frogs, weaving an eerie melody that lingers long after one departs.
