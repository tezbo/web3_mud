The shop crouches beneath a veil of clinging mist, its wooden beams dark with age and damp. Inside, the air is thick with the pungent aroma of dried herbs and musty parchment, a testament to its long-forgotten secrets. Shelves groan under the weight of glass jars filled with murky liquids, their contents casting distorted shadows that dance across the walls. The floorboards creak underfoot, each step echoing like a whispered promise in the eerie silence, while a chilly draft brushes against your skin, leaving a trail of goosebumps in its wake.
