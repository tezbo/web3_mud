The shop is a shadowy refuge, its walls draped in tattered velvet that whispers with the passing breeze. Shelves, layered with a patina of rust, cradle an assortment of peculiar trinkets that glint dully in the dim light. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the sharp bite of iron, mingling with the faint, sweet decay of forgotten herbs. Underfoot, the floorboards creak with a resonant groan, each step releasing a waft of musty air that clings to the skin like a damp cloak.
