Dimly lit by flickering lanterns, the shop is a cavern of shadows where whispers of rusted chains echo faintly against stone walls slick with moss. The air hangs heavy with the sweet, cloying scent of damp earth intermingled with the sharp tang of aged leather. Wooden shelves, warped and gnarled, cradle peculiar trinkets that beckon with the soft glow of jade and obsidian. As you brush past a velvet curtain, its texture is both lush and fraying, like the embrace of a forgotten past.
