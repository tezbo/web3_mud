The shop is a dimly lit cavern of curiosities, where the air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and the sharp tang of rusted iron. Shelves, carved from dark, gnarled wood, groan under the weight of shadowed trinkets and peculiar artifacts, each encrusted with a thin layer of moss. The soft whisper of dripping water echoes from unseen corners, creating a rhythmic backdrop to the muted clinks of metal chains swaying gently from the ceiling. As you brush against the rough, cold stone walls, a shiver climbs your spine, as if the very shadows are alive with secrets waiting to be unearthed.
