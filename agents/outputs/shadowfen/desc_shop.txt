The shop stands cloaked in perpetual twilight, its walls a tapestry of rusted iron and ancient, mold-blackened stone. Shelves groan under the weight of peculiar trinkets, their metallic surfaces slick with the ever-present dampness of the Shadowfen. A faint, acrid scent of moss and mildew lingers in the air, mingling with the sharper notes of fermented herbs hanging in bundles from the ceiling. The floorboards creak beneath every step, their warped wood whispering secrets with each footfall, while a distant dribble of water echoes softly, weaving a murmured melody that seeps into the bones.
