The shop crouches beneath a canopy of creeping vines, their tendrils draped like the fingers of a curious specter. Within, the air is thick with the earthy scent of damp peat and the metallic bite of rusted iron, mingling unpleasantly with the sweet decay of overripe fruit. Shadows coil in every corner, their presence punctuated by the flicker of a solitary lantern, casting a sickly yellow light that dances across rows of tarnished trinkets. The floorboards creak mournfully underfoot, their surface slick with a film of condensation that clings to your skin like a cold, unwelcome caress.
