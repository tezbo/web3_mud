In the dimly lit shop of Shadowfen, wisps of mist coil languidly around shelves laden with peculiar trinkets, their surfaces mottled with rust and age. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a testament to the marshland that encroaches upon every corner of the realm. Each creaky floorboard protests underfoot, the sound echoing like distant whispers in the gloom. As your fingers graze the relics, they leave a faint trail in the fine layer of dust, a testament to long-forgotten stories.
