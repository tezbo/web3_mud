The shop is a dim enclave where shadows pool like ink in the folds of ancient, velvet drapes. The air is thick with the musk of aged parchment and the sharp bite of rusting metal, a testament to relics that whisper of forgotten times. Wooden shelves, slick with moisture and draped in tendrils of mist, groan under the weight of dusty tomes and curious trinkets. A faint, rhythmic drip echoes from somewhere in the gloom, a metronome for the quiet rustle of unseen creatures skittering along the stone floor. As you touch the cold, slick surface of the counter, a shiver runs up your spine, as if the very walls are watching.
