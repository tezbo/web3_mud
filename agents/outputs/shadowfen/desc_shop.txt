The shop huddles beneath a canopy of twisting vines, their leaves whispering secrets as they brush against the weathered wood. Inside, the air hangs heavy with the earthy aroma of damp moss and the faint, biting scent of rusted metal. Lanterns flicker, casting soft pools of amber light that dance across shelves lined with curious relics—each one cool and slick to the touch, as if still kissed by the morning mist. The creak of floorboards accompanies each step, a gentle reminder of the marshland's encroaching presence.
