The shop in Shadowfen is a dim haven of mystery, its low ceiling draped with tattered, moss-green curtains that sway gently as if whispering secrets. The air is thick with the earthy scent of damp wood and the sharp bite of mildew, mingling with the faint sweetness of dried herbs hanging from the rafters. Shelves carved from weathered driftwood are laden with curiosities—glinting shards of obsidian, bottles of murky liquid, and rusted trinkets that hum softly with an ancient allure. Underfoot, the floorboards creak with a slow, deliberate groan, each step a reminder of the countless stories they've borne.
