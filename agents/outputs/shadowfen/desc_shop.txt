The shop huddles beneath a canopy of sagging moss, its timber walls slick with the perpetual damp of the Shadowfen. Inside, the air is thick with the earthy aroma of dried herbs and the sour tang of rusting iron trinkets. The floorboards creak softly underfoot, their surface worn smooth by countless passersby. Dim light filters through a grimy window, casting a spectral glow on shelves lined with peculiar relics and vials that clink softly as the swamp's breeze stirs the heavy curtain at the door.
