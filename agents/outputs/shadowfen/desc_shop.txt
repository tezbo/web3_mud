The air inside the Shadowfen shop is thick with the earthy aroma of damp moss, mingling with the sharp tang of iron rusting beneath a perpetual cloak of mist. Flickering candlelight casts wavering shadows over shelves lined with peculiar trinkets—a glint of tarnished silver, the dull gleam of aged brass. The soft squelch of the wooden floor underfoot whispers tales of countless visitors, their presence lingering like the faintest echo. An inexplicable chill brushes your skin, as if the very walls exhale a breath of the swamp outside, cool and laden with secrets.
