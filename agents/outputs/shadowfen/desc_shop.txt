The shop crouches beneath a canopy of ancient, gnarled trees, their limbs draped with ghostly veils of moss that whisper in the murmur of the fen's breath. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and rust, mingling with a faint hint of something sweet and rotten, like overripe fruit. Inside, the light is dim and flickering, cast by lanterns with tarnished brass casings; their glow dances across shelves cluttered with peculiar trinkets and potion vials. As you brush against the hanging strands of cobwebs, they cling momentarily to your skin, leaving a lingering chill that seems to seep into your bones.
