The shop nestles in the murky embrace of Shadowfen, its walls cloaked in a patchwork of moss and rusted iron. A faint luminescence seeps through clouded windows, casting ghostly silhouettes across shelves laden with mildewed tomes and tarnished relics. The air hums with a chorus of distant croaks and the soft patter of rain against the roof, while the earthy scent of damp peat mingles with the acrid tang of old parchment. As your fingers brush a faded velvet curtain, it releases a whisper of dust that dances in the dim light, leaving a gritty residue on your skin.
