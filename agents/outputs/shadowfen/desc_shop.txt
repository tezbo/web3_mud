In the dim glow of witchfire lanterns, the shop is a tapestry of shadow and rust, where the air hangs heavy with the musk of damp earth and aged leather. Shelves bow under the weight of peculiar artifacts, each cloaked in a fine patina of dust, whispering stories long forgotten. The floorboards creak beneath your step, their groans echoing softly amidst the distant drip of water, while the scent of old parchment mingles with a faint, sweet rot. The cool, clammy air brushes against your skin, leaving a tingling reminder of the swamp's eerie embrace just beyond the threshold.
