Shadows cling to the corners of the shop, where shelves sag under the weight of dusty tomes and glass vials filled with murky liquids. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and rust, mingling with the sharp tang of mold. A faint, rhythmic drip echoes from somewhere unseen, each splash a reminder of the swamp's encroaching presence. The floorboards creak beneath your feet, their surface slick with a thin film of moisture, while a chill seeps through the walls, wrapping around you like a damp cloak.
