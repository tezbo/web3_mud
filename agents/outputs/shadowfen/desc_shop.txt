The shop's air is thick with the scent of damp earth and aged leather, a testament to the marshland beyond its creaking door. Shadows flicker across the walls, cast by lanterns with glass stained in hues of deep emerald and rust. The floorboards, slick with moisture, groan underfoot, each step a whisper lost to the persistent patter of rain on the roof. Shelves sag under the weight of peculiar trinkets and vials, their glass surfaces cool and slick to the touch, reflecting the dim light in distorted patterns. Amidst the quiet, a distant croak echoes, a reminder of the swamp's ever-present embrace.
