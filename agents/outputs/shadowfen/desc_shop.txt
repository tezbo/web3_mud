Within the dim confines of the Shadowfen shop, the air hangs heavy with the musk of leather and the earthy undertone of dried herbs. Shelves of tarnished wood, slick with a perpetual sheen of mist, cradle an assortment of trinkets and potions that glint in the muted light filtering through stained glass. The soft, irregular drip of water echoes faintly from somewhere within, its rhythm a gentle counterpoint to the whispers of leaves brushing against the weathered stone walls outside. As you brush past a rack of cloaks, the fabric clings momentarily to your skin, damp and cool, leaving a faint trace of moss and old smoke in its wake.
