The shop huddles beneath a canopy of twisting branches, their gnarled silhouettes casting flickering shadows across cracked, moss-laden stones. Inside, the air is thick with the earthy scent of damp wood and the faint, acrid bite of old rust. The soft rustle of leaves brushing against the roof mingles with the distant drip of water, creating a muted symphony that seems to pulse with the heartbeat of the swamp. Shelves sag under the weight of peculiar artifacts, their surfaces slick with a thin film of moisture, cold and slightly tacky to the touch.
