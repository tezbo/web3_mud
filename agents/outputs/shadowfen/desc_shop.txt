The shop is a dim enclave where the light barely pierces through the cobwebbed eaves, casting a sepia hue over the cluttered wares. Shelves groan under the weight of dusty tomes and peculiar trinkets, each exuding a faint musk of mildew and age. The air is thick with the earthy scent of damp moss, mingling with the acrid bite of rusted metal. As you step inside, the floorboards creak softly beneath your feet, and the chill of the moist air clings to your skin like a second, clammy layer.
