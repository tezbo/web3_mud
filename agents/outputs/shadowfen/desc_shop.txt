A dim glow seeps through the shop's murky windows, casting elongated shadows across shelves laden with peculiar wares. The air is thick with the musty aroma of aged parchment and the sharp, earthy scent of dried herbs, mingling with the faint metallic rust that seems endemic to Shadowfen. The floorboards creak underfoot, their surfaces uneven and cool to the touch, as if the dampness of the swamp outside has seeped into their very grain. From somewhere in the back, the sound of a low, rhythmic drip punctuates the silence, adding a strange melody to the shop's atmosphere.
