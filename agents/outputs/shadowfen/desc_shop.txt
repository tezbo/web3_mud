The shop's shadowy interior is a labyrinth of shelves carved from twisted, gnarled wood, their surfaces slick with the eternal damp of the Shadowfen. A chorus of whispers rustles from the ceiling where strands of cobwebs sway, their threads glistening with trapped dew. The air is a heady mix of peat and mildew, underscored by the sharp, metallic scent of rusting iron trinkets that line the shelves. Beneath your fingers, the leather bindings of ancient tomes feel clammy, their pages musty with the secrets of ages past.
