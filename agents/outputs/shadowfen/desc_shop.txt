The shop is a dimly-lit haven, where pale moonlight filters through warped glass windows, casting ghostly patterns on the uneven wooden floor. Shelves lined with vials and rusted trinkets creak softly under the weight of forgotten memories, their metallic scent mingling with the sharp tang of damp earth. The air is thick with the aroma of aged parchment and the faintest whisper of mildew, clinging to your skin like a cold embrace. As you move, the floorboards groan underfoot, a soft, mournful echo that seems to follow you through the shadowed aisles.
