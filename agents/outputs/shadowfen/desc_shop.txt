The dimly lit shop is a symphony of shadows and whispers, its corners shrouded in a perpetual mist that clings to the floor like a living thing. Shelves of aged, dark wood groan under the weight of curiosities, their surfaces slick with the dampness of the fen. The air is thick with the scent of decaying leaves and the faint, acrid tang of rusted metal, mingling with the sharp aroma of preserved herbs. Each step on the uneven, stone floor sends a soft echo through the space, as if the shop itself is murmuring secrets in the language of the marsh.
