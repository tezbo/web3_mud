The shop huddles in the misty embrace of Shadowfen, its warped wooden shelves laden with peculiar wares. The air inside is thick and damp, carrying the earthy musk of decaying leaves and the faint, acrid bite of rusting metal. A single lantern flickers, casting jittering shadows that dance along the walls, where glistening, dew-damp cobwebs cling. Beneath your fingers, the counter feels slick and cold, its surface etched with mysterious runes that pulse softly in the gloom. The floorboards creak with the whisper of unseen voices, adding an eerie melody to the silence.
