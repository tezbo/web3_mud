The shop is a dimly lit sanctuary, where the air is thick with the earthy aroma of peat and the faint tang of rust. Shadows cling to every corner, their edges blurred by the perpetual mist that seeps in from the fen. Shelves creak softly under the weight of forgotten trinkets and tarnished relics, each piece cold and slick to the touch, like a memory long buried. A low murmur of dripping water echoes from the stone walls, weaving a melody of solitude and secret whispers.
