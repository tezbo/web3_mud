Within the dim confines of the Shadowfen shop, the air is thick with the pungent aroma of damp earth and decaying leaves, mingling with the sharp scent of rusting metal. Shelves of gnarled wood bow under the weight of peculiar trinkets, their surfaces etched with intricate, swirling patterns that seem to shift with the flickering light of a solitary, sputtering candle. The soft, almost imperceptible hum of whispered incantations reverberates through the room, echoing off the stone walls slick with moisture. As your fingers brush against the cool, uneven surface of a jade amulet, you feel a faint, tingling pulse, as if the very object breathes with an ancient, slumbering magic.
