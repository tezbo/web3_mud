The shop stands nestled in the Shadowfen, its wooden frame mottled with the green patina of creeping moss. Inside, the air is thick with the sharp, earthy scent of dried herbs, mingling with the musty odor of ancient parchment. Shadows dance across walls cluttered with rusty trinkets and shimmering glass vials, their colors muted by the low, flickering light of a single lantern. Underfoot, the floorboards creak softly, their surfaces worn smooth by countless footsteps, while the distant croak of frogs echoes faintly through the ever-present mist just beyond the threshold.
