In the dim, flickering light of the shop, shelves groan under the weight of rust-streaked trinkets, each touched by the creeping embrace of the Shadowfen's perpetual mist. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and old leather, mingling with the sharp, metallic bite of oxidized iron. Each footstep on the warped floorboards echoes softly, a gentle creak that harmonizes with the distant drip of water from somewhere unseen. As you run your fingers along the cool, slightly damp surface of a jade amulet, a whisper of chill seems to seep into your bones, leaving a lingering trace of the fen's eerie melancholy.
