The shop's narrow doorway yawns open like a secret, inviting the curious into its dimly lit interior. Tendrils of mist coil around the worn wooden shelves, where trinkets of rusted metal and tarnished silver lie in disarray, whispering stories of forgotten owners. The air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and old leather, intertwined with the sharp bite of incense burning in a corner. As you brush against the faded velvet drapes, a chill creeps up your spine, as if the shadows themselves were reaching out to greet you.
