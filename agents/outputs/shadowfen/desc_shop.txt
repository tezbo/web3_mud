In the dim confines of the Shadowfen shop, the air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and the sharp tang of rusting iron. Shelves, warped and slick with moisture, creak under the weight of peculiar trinkets—each a curious amalgam of bone, wood, and corroded metal. A faint, persistent dripping echoes through the space, punctuating the thick silence and heightening the sense of time forgotten. Your fingertips skim across a rough-hewn counter, its surface cool and slick like the underbelly of a stone in a shaded creek.
