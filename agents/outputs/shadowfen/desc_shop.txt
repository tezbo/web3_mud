The shop is a dim sanctuary nestled within the Shadowfen's perpetual mist, its wooden beams softened by creeping tendrils of moss. Lanterns, their glass panes fogged with age, cast a flickering glow over the cluttered shelves, where bottles of murky potions glint beneath a patina of dust. A damp, earthy scent clings to the air, mingling with the sharp tang of herbs hung in bundles from the ceiling, their dried leaves whispering with each ghostly draft. As you brush against a shelf, the worn wood is cool and slightly slick beneath your fingertips, a reminder of the endless rains outside.
