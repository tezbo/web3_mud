The shop is a dim-lit alcove, where the air clings like damp velvet, carrying the earthy aroma of moss and the sharp bite of rusted iron. Shelves sag with the weight of peculiar trinkets, their surfaces slick with a thin film of moisture that clings to your fingertips. The faint drip of water echoes from somewhere unseen, a rhythmic counterpoint to the whispered rustle of parchment as the shopkeeper turns a page. Lanterns of tarnished copper cast a sepia glow, their light flickering like distant will-o'-wisps, revealing glimpses of mysterious shadows that dance along the walls.
