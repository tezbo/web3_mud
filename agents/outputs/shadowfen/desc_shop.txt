The shop's wooden door creaks open, revealing a dimly lit interior where shadows cling to the corners like wary specters. The air is thick with the musk of aged leather and the faint, metallic tang of rust. Shelves groan under the weight of peculiar artifacts, their surfaces slick with a sheen of moisture, as if the swamp beyond has seeped inside. A soft, eerie melody hums from a cracked gramophone in the corner, its notes weaving through the damp air like whispers from forgotten souls.
