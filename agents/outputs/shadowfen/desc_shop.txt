The shop is a dim enclave, its atmosphere heavy with the scent of damp earth and the faint, acrid bite of rust. Shelves, warped and slick with moisture, groan beneath the weight of peculiar trinkets—a tarnished compass, a vial of shimmering mist, and a dagger with a hilt of twisted bone. The soft plinking of water droplets echoes in the cool air, a lullaby of the swamp beyond the warped wooden door. Shadows cling to every corner, their velvety caress whispering secrets to any who linger too long within.
