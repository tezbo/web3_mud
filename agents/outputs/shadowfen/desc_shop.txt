Moss-clad stones form the walls of the Shadowfen shop, their surfaces slick with perpetual damp, exuding an earthy musk that clings to the air. Flickering lanterns cast a wavering amber glow, dancing shadows playing across shelves laden with peculiar curios: tarnished trinkets and glass vials filled with swirling, opaque liquids. The floorboards creak softly underfoot, their grain rough and uneven, while the faint, haunting melody of a wind chime crafted from hollowed bone sways in the corner, whispering secrets carried by the fen's mist. A cool draft slithers through gaps in the stone, carrying the faint tang of rust and the lingering bitterness of peat.
