In the dimly lit shop of Shadowfen, the air is thick with the musty scent of aged parchment and the faint metallic bite of rusting iron. Shelves, carved from gnarled swampwood, creak softly under the weight of peculiar trinkets and dusty tomes. A thin veil of mist snakes through the cracks in the stone walls, leaving a cool, damp touch on the skin. The quiet, punctuated by the distant drip of water, wraps around you like a whispered secret, inviting you to explore the mysteries hidden within the shadows.
