The shop crouches beneath a canopy of gnarled branches, their twisted forms etched against a sullen sky. Inside, the air is thick with the earthy musk of damp leather and the faint, acrid bite of rusted iron. Shelves sag under the weight of peculiar trinkets: tarnished lanterns, bottles of swirling mist, and ancient maps that crackle like dry leaves when touched. The floor creaks with every footstep, a low groan that mingles with the distant drip of water echoing from unseen corners.
