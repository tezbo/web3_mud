The shop is an alcove of shadows, where flickering lanterns cast trembling light over walls streaked with rust and timeworn jade. The air is thick with the musty scent of damp earth mixed with the sharp tang of dried herbs hanging in bundles from the low ceiling. A soft, persistent drip echoes from the corner, a reminder of the swamp's embrace just beyond the wooden door. Beneath your fingers, the counter is rough-hewn and cool, its surface etched with strange symbols that hum faintly under your touch.
