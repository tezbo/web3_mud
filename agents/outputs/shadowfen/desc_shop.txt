The shop is a half-forgotten corner of the Shadowfen, where dim, flickering lanterns cast long shadows that dance across the rust-streaked walls. The air is thick with the earthy scent of moss and the faint metallic aroma of damp iron, mingling with the pungent tang of aged leather. Shelves bow under the weight of strange trinkets, their surfaces cool and slick to the touch, as if the chill of the fen itself seeped into them. A low murmur of dripping water echoes from somewhere unseen, a haunting melody that threads through the silence like a whispered secret.
