The shop's air hangs thick with the musk of damp earth and the faint, acrid bite of rusted metal. Shadows slither across the stone floor, weaving between shelves crowded with peculiar trinkets that glint dully in the dim light. The whisper of your footsteps is swallowed by the oppressive silence, broken only by the occasional creak of warped wood and the distant drip of water. As your fingers brush against the dusty, timeworn surfaces, a shiver races up your spine, as if the very room holds its breath, waiting.
