The shop crouches beneath a canopy of twisting vines, their tendrils weaving through cracked, moss-covered shingles. Inside, the air hangs heavy with the earthy scent of damp soil and the sharp tang of rusting iron. The floorboards creak underfoot, their groans echoing like distant whispers in the mist-laden air. Flickering lanterns cast wavering shadows, illuminating shelves lined with curious trinkets and potions, each bottle cool and slick to the touch, promising secrets unknown.
