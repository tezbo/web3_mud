Dim lanterns cast a bruised glow over shelves laden with peculiar trinkets, each coated in a thin veil of dust and shadow. The air is thick with the earthy scent of damp wood and the faint, acrid bite of rusted metal, mingling with the sweet decay of dried herbs strung from the low-beamed ceiling. Beneath your feet, the warped wooden floorboards creak softly, their groans swallowed by the muffled croak of distant frogs echoing through the walls. As your fingers brush against a velvet pouch, a shiver of cool anticipation runs through you, the fabric whispering secrets of forgotten spells and ancient pacts.
