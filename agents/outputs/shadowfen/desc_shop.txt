The shop in Shadowfen is a dim-lit cavern where wisps of mist coil languidly around rusted lanterns, their flickering flames casting eerie shadows on the damp stone walls. Shelves sag under the weight of peculiar trinkets, each exuding a faint, musty aroma mingled with the sharp tang of aged iron. The floorboards creak softly underfoot, their surfaces slick with condensation, while the distant drip of water echoes like a forgotten melody. As you touch the worn, leather-bound volumes stacked precariously on a table, their surfaces feel cold and slightly tacky, as if the swamp itself clings to every object within.
