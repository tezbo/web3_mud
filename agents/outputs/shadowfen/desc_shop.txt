Dim light filters through the grimy windows of the Shadowfen shop, casting fractured shadows across shelves laden with peculiar artifacts. A musty odor of mildew mingles with the sharper scent of rusted metal, as if the very air clings to memories of long-forgotten eras. The soft rustle of parchment whispers from a distant corner, where a solitary candle flickers, illuminating an array of ancient tomes with spines cracked and weary. Each step on the warped wooden floorboards sends a shiver of vibration up your legs, the texture of the grain rough against your fingertips as you steady yourself against a nearby shelf.
