The shop nestles in the shadowed embrace of gnarled willow roots, its walls a patchwork of moss and creeping vines. Inside, the air is thick with the rich, loamy scent of damp earth, mingling with the sharp tang of dried herbs strung overhead. The muted patter of raindrops against the window creates a rhythmic lullaby, while the floorboards creak softly beneath feet, their surface worn smooth and cool to the touch. Flickering lanterns cast wavering patterns across shelves brimming with rusty tools and peculiar trinkets, each whispered over by the breeze slipping through the cracks.
