The shop is a dim labyrinth, its shelves carved from gnarled roots that twist like ancient secrets. The air is heavy with the earthy musk of damp wood and the biting scent of herbs drying in bundles overhead. A faint, rhythmic dripping echoes from somewhere unseen, adding a percussive heartbeat to the hushed whispers of customers haggling in shadowy corners. As your fingers brush against the worn leather of a tome, the coolness of its moisture-slicked surface sends a shiver up your spine, grounding you in the eerie, timeless atmosphere of the Shadowfen.
