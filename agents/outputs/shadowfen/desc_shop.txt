Veils of silvery mist seep through cracks in the shop's decaying wooden walls, curling around shelves laden with tarnished trinkets and peculiar curios. The air is thick with the musty scent of damp earth and a hint of something metallic, like iron forgotten in rain. Each footfall on the creaking floorboards releases a soft echo, swallowed swiftly by the enveloping fog. A distant tinkling, akin to chimes caught in a breeze, teases the ear, promising secrets whispered just beyond reach.
