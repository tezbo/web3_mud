The shop crouches beneath a canopy of ancient trees, their gnarled roots curling like the fingers of a sleeping giant. Inside, the air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the faintest whisper of mildew, mingling with the sharp tang of rusted metal. Shelves, warped and slick with condensation, groan under the weight of peculiar trinkets—tarnished amulets, cracked bottles filled with swirling mist, and daggers with handles wrapped in leather worn smooth by countless hands. A lone lantern casts a feeble glow, its flame flickering shadows that dance and twist like phantoms across the peeling walls.
