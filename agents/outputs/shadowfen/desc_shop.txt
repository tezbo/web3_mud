The shop is a dim haven amidst the murky embrace of Shadowfen, where shadows weave between shelves cluttered with rusted trinkets and mist-kissed relics. The air is thick with the musty scent of damp earth and aged leather, mingling with the sharp, metallic bite of iron filings scattered like forgotten memories. Each step on the uneven wooden floorboards releases a soft creak, echoing like whispers through the gloom, while a faint, eerie tinkling of wind chimes made from bone and wire adds a spectral melody. As your fingers brush against the cool, slick surfaces of jade ornaments, a chill seeps through your skin, as if the very essence of the marsh had seeped into their veins.
