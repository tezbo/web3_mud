In the dim recesses of the Shadowfen shop, the air is thick with the earthy aroma of damp moss and the musty scent of ancient tomes. Faint, rhythmic drips echo from the sodden rafters, each drop splattering onto the uneven stone floor like a whispered secret. Shelves of tarnished metal and weathered wood groan under the weight of peculiar trinkets—a rusted lantern, a cracked mirror reflecting flickers of candlelight, and jars filled with swirling, shadowy substances. As your fingers brush the frayed edges of a velvet cloak, a chill seeps through, reminiscent of the mist that perpetually shrouds the fen.
