In the dim light of the Shadowfen shop, shelves sag under the weight of peculiar curiosities, each cloaked in a thin veil of dust. The air is thick with the earthy musk of damp wood and the faint, acrid scent of rusting metal, mingling with a subtle undertone of something sweetly decayed. As you move, the floorboards groan softly beneath your feet, and the faint tinkle of wind chimes, fashioned from bone and glass, echoes a ghostly melody from somewhere unseen. Your fingers brush against the cool, slick surface of jade trinkets, their edges worn smooth by countless hands before yours.
