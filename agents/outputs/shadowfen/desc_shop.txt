In the dimly lit shop, the air is thick with the scent of damp earth and aged leather, mingling with a faint trace of something metallic and sharp. Shelves of rusted curios and ancient trinkets line the walls, their surfaces slick with the perpetual moisture that clings to everything in the Shadowfen. The floor creaks underfoot, each step a whispered protest, as if the shop itself is reluctant to reveal its secrets. A distant drip of water echoes softly, a rhythmic heartbeat in the murky gloom, as your fingers brush against the cool, slick edges of mysterious relics that seem to pulse with stories long forgotten.
