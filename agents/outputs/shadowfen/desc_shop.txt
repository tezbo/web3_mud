The shop stands shrouded in a perpetual half-light, its wooden beams mottled with creeping vines of rust-red moss. A symphony of muted whispers echoes off the walls, as if the shadows themselves are in quiet conversation. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint metallic bite of ancient iron. Shelves, slick and cool to the touch, hold an eclectic assortment of wares: tarnished trinkets, faded tomes, and glass vials filled with swirling, inky mists that seem to pulse with a life of their own.
