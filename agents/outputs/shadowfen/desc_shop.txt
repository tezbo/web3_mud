The shop crouches in the Shadowfen gloom, its exterior a patchwork of weathered wood and creeping moss, like a forgotten relic swallowed by the swamp. Inside, the air is thick with the earthy scent of dried herbs and the sharper, metallic tang of rusted trinkets. Flickering candlelight casts wavery shadows across shelves cluttered with glass jars, each containing mysterious contents that clink softly when disturbed. The floorboards creak beneath your feet, their worn surfaces rough and cool, as distant drips echo from unseen corners, a constant reminder of the encroaching damp.
