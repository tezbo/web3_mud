In the dim light of the shop, the air is thick with the earthy scent of damp moss and the faint metallic tang of rust. Shadows dance across walls cluttered with trinkets and relics, each item whispering tales from the mire beyond. The wooden floorboards creak softly underfoot, their surface rough and cool, as if the swamp's chill has seeped into the very bones of the building. A muted chorus of croaks and chirps filters in from the marsh outside, mingling with the rustle of leaves brushing against the stone facade, creating a symphony of the Shadowfen's eternal twilight.
