The shop is a haven of shadow and whisper, its air thick with the earthy scent of damp wood and the faint tang of rust. Shelves carved from dark mahogany loom like ancient sentinels, their surfaces slick with the ever-present mist that clings to all things in the Shadowfen. Candlelight flickers, casting ghostly patterns that dance across the walls, while the soft shuffle of feet on the creaking floorboards echoes like whispers in the gloom. A chill hangs in the air, brushing against your skin like the breath of forgotten secrets, as your fingers graze the cool, serpentine curves of jade trinkets and the roughened texture of leather-bound tomes.
