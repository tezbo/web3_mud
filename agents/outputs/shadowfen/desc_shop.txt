In the dimly lit shop, the air hangs heavy with the musty scent of ancient parchment mingled with the earthiness of damp moss clinging to the stone walls. The soft, rhythmic drip of water echoes from a distant corner, each droplet splashing onto the uneven flagstone floor and sending ripples of sound through the shadows. Shelves of rusted iron bend under the weight of mysterious tomes and peculiar trinkets, their surfaces cold to the touch, whispering secrets of forgotten lore. The flickering glow of a single candle casts a wavering dance of light across the jade-eyed skull that adorns the counter, its hollow gaze following each visitor with a silent, spectral curiosity.
