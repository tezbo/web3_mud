The shop crouches beneath a canopy of twisted, moss-draped trees, their branches clawing at the murky air. Inside, the dim light filters through grime-streaked windows, casting eerie shadows over shelves laden with peculiar trinkets and rusted curios. A damp, earthy scent mingles with the sharp tang of old iron, while the faint gurgle of a distant bog echoes through the cracked walls. Your fingers brush against the cold, clammy surface of a leather-bound tome, its pages whispering secrets as they flutter in the draft.
