The shop huddles in the embrace of the Shadowfen mist, its wooden beams slick with dew, a testament to years of persistent damp. A cacophony of whispers echoes within, the voices of unseen patrons bargaining over relics of forgotten times. The air is thick with the pungent aroma of aged leather and the sharp tang of iron, mingling with the earthy scent of moss creeping up the stone walls. Each step across the warped floorboards releases a groaning protest, as if the building itself is reluctant to reveal its secrets.
