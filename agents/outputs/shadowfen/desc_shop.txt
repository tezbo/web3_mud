The shop is a dim sanctuary amidst the perpetual twilight of Shadowfen, where shelves sag under the weight of peculiar curiosities. A thin veil of mist creeps in through the half-open door, mingling with the heady aroma of damp earth and aged parchment. The floorboards, slick with the seepage of the fen, groan softly beneath each step, echoing like distant whispers. Flickering lanterns cast an amber glow, illuminating the ghostly outlines of rusted trinkets and shadowed corners, where secrets seem to slumber in the gloom.
