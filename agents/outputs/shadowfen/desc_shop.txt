In the heart of Shadowfen, the shop stands cloaked in perpetual twilight, its rust-covered sign creaking softly as it sways in the damp breeze. Inside, the air is thick with the earthy aroma of moss and the faint, acrid tang of aged parchment. Shelves groan under the weight of peculiar artifacts: tarnished trinkets and glass jars filled with swirling mists that whisper secrets when disturbed. A cool, pervasive mist licks at your skin, leaving a trace of moisture that chills the bones, while the muted glow of lanterns casts flickering shadows that dance like ghostly apparitions across the stone floor.
