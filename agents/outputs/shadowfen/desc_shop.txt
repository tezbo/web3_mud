The shop in Shadowfen is a dimly lit haven, where the air hangs heavy with the earthy scent of damp moss and aged wood. Shelves carved from gnarled branches hold an array of peculiar wares, their surfaces slick with perpetual dew, cool to the touch. A faint, eerie melody emanates from a corner, the soft clinking of rusted wind chimes mingling with the distant croak of frogs. Shadows dance across the walls, cast by flickering lanterns that bathe the room in a ghostly, amber glow.
