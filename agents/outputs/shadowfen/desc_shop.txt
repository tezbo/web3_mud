The shop is a chiaroscuro of shadows and flickering lamplight, where the damp air clings like a second skin. Shelves groan under the weight of peculiar trinkets, each dusted with a thin layer of rust that hints at forgotten histories. The scent of aged leather and musty tomes mingles with a faint, acrid whiff of something herbal and mysterious. A subtle drip echoes from somewhere deep within, punctuating the hushed whispers of the shopkeeper and patrons, their voices as soft and secretive as the murky fen outside.
