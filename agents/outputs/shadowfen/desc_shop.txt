The shop's interior is cloaked in a shroud of whispering shadows, where the air is thick with the earthy scent of damp moss and aged parchment. Shelves, crafted from gnarled, twisted wood, creak quietly under the weight of peculiar trinkets that glint with faint, ghostly luminescence. The floorboards, slick with a persistent sheen of moisture, groan underfoot, adding a low, rhythmic symphony to the quiet murmur of distant, unseen waters. A cool, clammy breeze drifts through the open doorway, carrying with it the faint metallic taste of rust and distant rain.
