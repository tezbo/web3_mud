The shop is a sanctuary of shadows, where the dim glow of lanterns casts flickering patterns across walls lined with ancient, rusting tools. The air hangs thick with the earthy perfume of damp moss and the acrid scent of iron, mingling in a heady, intoxicating blend. Underfoot, the wooden floor creaks and groans, its surface cool and slick with perpetual moisture. Each whispered footstep seems to echo, swallowed by the dense fog that curls in from the marshes outside, carrying with it a faint, swampy breath of decay.
