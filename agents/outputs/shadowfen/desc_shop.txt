Dim light filters through a canopy of interwoven branches, casting a dappled pattern on the damp, earthen floor of the Shadowfen shop. Shelves carved from ancient, moss-covered wood line the walls, creaking softly under the weight of glass vials filled with swirling, luminescent liquids. The air is thick with the pungent aroma of wet leaves and the faint, metallic bite of swamp water, tinged with the sweet decay of fallen foliage. A distant croak echoes from outside, resonating through the shop like a ghostly lullaby, while your fingers brush against the moist, cool surfaces of the polished counters, slick with the constant humidity of the fen.
