A dim glow filters through the shop's grime-streaked windows, casting the interior in shades of muted, swampy green. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint, acrid odor of rusting metal. Shelves sag under the weight of peculiar trinkets, their surfaces cool and slick with a perpetual film of moisture. The quiet drip of water echoes from somewhere unseen, punctuated by the soft rustle of unseen creatures shifting in the shadows. As you move, the floorboards creak softly, their edges worn smooth by countless footsteps.
