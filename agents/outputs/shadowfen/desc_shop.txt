The shop crouches in the misty embrace of Shadowfen, its wooden beams groaning softly under the weight of time and secrets. Shelves lined with tarnished trinkets and rusted curiosities seem to whisper stories from forgotten eras, their surfaces cool and slightly damp to the touch. A faint, earthy aroma of wet leaves and ancient moss permeates the air, mingling with the acrid scent of old iron. The low, rhythmic drip of moisture from the ceiling echoes like a heartbeat, a reminder of the swamp's encroachment.
