In the dim light of the Shadowfen shop, shelves sag beneath the weight of peculiar trinkets and rusted curiosities, each telling tales from forgotten times. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and aged leather, punctuated by the faint, acrid tang of iron. A low, persistent dripping echoes from somewhere unseen, a reminder of the swamp’s ever-present moisture that clings to the skin like a clammy embrace. Beneath your feet, the floorboards creak softly, their worn surfaces cool and slick with a fine layer of mist.
