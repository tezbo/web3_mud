The shop crouches like a secret in the mist-drenched alley, its exterior draped in creeping vines that glisten with dew. Inside, the air is thick with the earthy scent of damp wood and rusted iron, mingling with a sharp tang of dried herbs. Shelves, worn and slick to the touch, are laden with mysterious trinkets, their surfaces etched with the patina of age. A soft, rhythmic drip echoes from somewhere unseen, and the distant croak of a frog punctuates the heavy silence, grounding the space in the swampy embrace of Shadowfen.
