In the dim light of the Shadowfen shop, shelves groan under the weight of peculiar trinkets, their surfaces dusted with the ghostly residue of time. The air is thick with the earthy scent of damp moss, mingling with the sharper notes of rust and decay that linger like whispered secrets. A distant drip echoes rhythmically, punctuating the muffled rustling of unseen creatures. As you brush against a tattered velvet curtain, the fabric feels cool and clammy, as if imbued with the chill of the fen itself.
