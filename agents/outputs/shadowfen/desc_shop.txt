The shop crouches in the swirling mist of Shadowfen, its wooden beams darkened with age and dampness. Inside, the air is thick with the earthy aroma of peat and the faintly metallic scent of rusted trinkets, each one whispering tales of forgotten times. The low murmur of distant swamp creatures filters through the cracked windows, mingling with the soft clinking of glass vials that line the shadowed shelves. Your fingers brush against the cool, slick surface of a jade amulet, its smoothness a stark contrast to the rough burlap sacks piled in a corner, heavy with unknown contents.
