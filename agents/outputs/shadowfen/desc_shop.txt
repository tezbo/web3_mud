Dim light filters through the warped glass of the shop's lone window, casting fragmented shadows that dance upon shelves laden with peculiar wares. The air is thick with the damp, earthy aroma of moss and aged parchment, underscored by the faint metallic whiff of rust. Each footfall is absorbed by the soft, squelching floorboards, their surfaces slick with a perpetual layer of mist. The quiet is punctuated only by the soft clinking of delicate glass vials, their contents swirling with an otherworldly luminescence that beckons the curious and the wary alike.
