The shop crouches at the edge of a swirling mist, its wooden walls bleached and cracked by time and damp. Shelves lined with tarnished trinkets and rusted curiosities creak under the weight of forgotten histories, while the air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. A faint, eerie melody, like the whisper of wind through hollow bones, weaves through the room, tugging at the edges of consciousness. The chill of the Shadowfen seeps through the floorboards, numbing fingers that brush against the cold, clammy surfaces of the mysterious wares.
