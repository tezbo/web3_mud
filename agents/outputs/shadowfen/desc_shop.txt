The shop crouches beneath a canopy of gnarled, moss-covered beams, where the air hangs thick with the earthy scent of damp wood and faint whispers of mildew. Lanterns of stained glass cast fractured pools of dim, greenish light across shelves laden with curious trinkets and oddities, each item bearing the patina of age and neglect. The floorboards creak with every step, their surfaces uneven and slick with a thin layer of moisture that clings to the soles of your boots. In the distance, the low murmur of the swamp seeps through the walls, a constant reminder of the encroaching wildness beyond.
