In the heart of Shadowfen, a shop crouches like a forgotten relic, its walls cloaked in veils of creeping mist. The faint, acrid scent of rust and damp earth permeates the air, mingling with the bitter undertone of ancient herbs. Shelves of shadowed wood groan under the weight of peculiar trinkets, their surfaces cool and slick with condensation. The soft rustle of unseen vermin echoes from the corners, a reminder of the unseen life that thrives in the gloom.
