In the dim half-light of the Shadowfen library, shelves of ancient tomes seem to emerge from the swirling mist like silent sentinels. The air is thick with the musty scent of aged parchment, mingling with the faint metallic odor of rusting chandeliers overhead. As you step inside, the floorboards creak softly beneath your weight, their smooth, worn surfaces cool to the touch. The gentle susurration of pages turning echoes through the room, a whisper of secrets waiting to be unveiled.
