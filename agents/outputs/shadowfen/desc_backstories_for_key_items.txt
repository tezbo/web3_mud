In the dim heart of Shadowfen, a library carved from ancient stone breathes with the weight of untold histories. Shelves groan under the burden of tomes bound in cracked leather, their spines a tapestry of faded symbols. A perpetual mist coils around your ankles, cool and damp against the skin, whispering secrets as pages rustle with a life of their own. The air is thick with the earthy scent of mildew, mingling with the faint acrid tang of ink, while the distant drip of water echoes like a forgotten clock, marking time in this sanctuary of stories.
