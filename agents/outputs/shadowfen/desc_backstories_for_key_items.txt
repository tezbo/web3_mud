In the dimly lit alcove of the Shadowfen library, the air hangs heavy with the scent of aged parchment and the earthy musk of moss creeping along the stone walls. Flickering candlelight dances over shelves cluttered with artifacts, their surfaces pockmarked by rust and veiled in cobwebs. A hushed whisper of turning pages echoes softly, as if the books themselves murmur secrets to those who dare to listen. The cool, damp air caresses your skin, leaving a fine mist in its wake, as your fingers brush against the brittle, leather-bound tomes filled with tales long forgotten.
