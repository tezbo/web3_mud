The chamber is a tapestry of shadows, where rusted chains hang like forgotten memories amidst the veiling mist. The air is thick with the earthy musk of damp parchment and the sharp, acrid bite of ink, mingling with the faint whisper of pages turning of their own accord. A dim glow seeps from tarnished lanterns, casting flickering patterns that dance across the jade walls, their texture cool and slick beneath your fingertips. The silence is punctuated by the distant drip of water, each drop a ghostly echo in the gloom.
