Dim light filters through the dense canopy of the Shadowfen, casting the room in an ever-shifting tapestry of shadows and muted greens. The air is thick with the earthy scent of damp moss and decaying leaves, mingling with the faint metallic tang of ancient, rusted artifacts. The floor underfoot is uneven, a patchwork of slick stone and creeping tendrils that brush against your skin with a cold, persistent touch. Whispers of forgotten tales seem to echo off the walls, a soft susurration that mingles with the distant drip of unseen water, inviting the curious to uncover the secrets hidden within the weathered tomes and relics scattered throughout.
