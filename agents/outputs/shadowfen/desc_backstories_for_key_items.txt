In the dim recesses of the Shadowfen library, shelves of warped and worn wood groan under the weight of ancient tomes, their spines cracked like the bark of elder trees. A pervasive scent of mildew and ink hangs heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, acrid tang of something long forgotten. The soft rustle of parchment echoes as spectral drafts whisper through the room, caressing your skin with a chill that lingers like a forgotten memory. Each tome hums with latent secrets, its cover cool and gritty beneath your fingers, promising tales that twist through the mists of time.
