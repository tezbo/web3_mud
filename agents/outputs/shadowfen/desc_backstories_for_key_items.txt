The room is cloaked in perpetual twilight, where the air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and rusting iron. Shadows slither across the walls, weaving between shelves burdened with ancient tomes and curios, each whispering secrets in a language long forgotten. The floor, slick with moisture, yields slightly underfoot, as if the marsh itself were reaching up to reclaim its treasures. A distant drip echoes through the chamber, punctuating the oppressive silence with a steady reminder of time's relentless passage.
