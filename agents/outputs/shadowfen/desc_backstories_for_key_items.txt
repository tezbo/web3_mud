In the dim confines of the Shadowfen's hidden archive, the air hangs heavy with the scent of vellum and the musk of ancient ink. Flickering candlelight dances across the walls, illuminating shelves that sag beneath the weight of tomes bound in cracked leather and rusted clasps. The soft rustle of parchment whispers secrets long forgotten, while the floor beneath your boots creaks with the groans of wood swollen by the pervasive damp. Each touch of a spine or scroll leaves a faint trace of dust on your fingertips, a tactile reminder of the countless stories waiting to be unearthed.
