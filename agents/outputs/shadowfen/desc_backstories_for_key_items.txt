In the dim recesses of the Shadowfen, the room known as Backstories for Key Items hums with the quiet rustle of ancient parchment. The air is thick with the earthy scent of dampened moss, mingling with the sharp bite of aged ink. An ever-present mist clings to every surface, making the rusted iron shelves slick to the touch, laden with scrolls and tomes bound in worn leather. Faint echoes of whispered secrets seem to linger in the corners, as if the very walls themselves are steeped in the tales of forgotten artifacts.
