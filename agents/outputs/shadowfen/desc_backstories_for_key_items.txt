The chamber is cloaked in a dim, otherworldly glow, the only light seeping through cracks in the ancient stone walls, casting eerie shadows that dance like specters. A damp chill hangs in the air, the scent of decaying parchment mingling with the earthy musk of the Shadowfen beyond. As you move, the floor beneath your feet feels slick and uneven, as though the very stones are reluctantly yielding their secrets. The soft rustle of pages turning, as if by unseen hands, echoes through the room, each whisper carrying tales long forgotten yet yearning to be heard.
