The dim chamber is a tapestry of shadows, where the air hangs heavy with the scent of ancient parchment and the earthy musk of dampened wood. Lanterns of tarnished brass flicker weakly, casting fleeting glimmers across shelves burdened with tomes, each spine etched with cryptic runes. A soft rustle echoes as pages turn on their own, whispering secrets to those who listen closely. The cool, gritty texture of the stone floor bites at bare feet, grounding visitors in the weight of forgotten lore and untold stories.
