In the heart of Shadowfen, a dim chamber lies cloaked in perpetual twilight, where the air hangs heavy with the scent of aged parchment and wet stone. Shelves of rusted iron, lined with tomes bound in cracked leather and brittle scrolls, crowd the walls, their spines whispering secrets of forgotten ages. The floor, slick with a film of moss, muffles footsteps to a ghostly hush, while the distant drip of water echoes like a forgotten lullaby. A single, guttering lantern casts flickering shadows that dance across the room, illuminating a central table strewn with ancient relics, each exuding an aura of stories untold, their surfaces cool and rough to the touch.
