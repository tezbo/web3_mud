A faint, musty scent of aged parchment mingles with the earthy aroma of damp moss creeping along the stone walls. The soft rustle of pages turning echoes like whispers in the gloom, while the air hangs thick, brushing cool and velvety against the skin. Dim lanterns cast flickering shadows that dance across the floor, revealing glimpses of ancient runes etched into the floorboards, each one a secret waiting to be unearthed.
