In the dim light of Shadowfen, the walls of the archive loom like ancient sentinels, their surfaces mottled with creeping moss and the rust-red stains of time. A thick, musty aroma hangs in the air, a blend of decaying parchment and the faint metallic scent of ink long dried. The soft whisper of turning pages echoes softly, a lullaby of secrets shared between the shadows. As your fingers brush against the spines of forgotten tomes, the leather is cool and cracked, each volume a guardian of the stories etched upon its pages.
