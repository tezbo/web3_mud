In the dim glow of flickering lanterns, the room is a cluttered haven where stories murmur between the cracks of ancient, moss-covered bricks. Aged parchments, their edges curling like autumn leaves, spill across a wooden table scarred by time and tales, while the musky scent of aged leather and ink saturates the cool, damp air. The faint rustle of a rat's tail against stone is barely audible beneath the steady drip of water from the ceiling, each droplet a metronome marking the passage of secrets. As you brush against the walls, their dampness clings to your fingertips, whispering of forgotten journeys and the weight of history.
