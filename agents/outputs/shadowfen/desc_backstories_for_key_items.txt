In the dim, flickering light of the Shadowfen, the room is suffused with a murky, sepia glow. Shelves of ancient, rust-buckled iron line the walls, each laden with relics and artifacts that whisper of bygone eras. The air is thick with the scent of old parchment and the earthy musk of decaying wood, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of something long forgotten. As you move, the floorboards creak softly beneath your feet, their groans echoing like distant thunder in the oppressive silence, while the cool, damp air clings to your skin like a shroud.
