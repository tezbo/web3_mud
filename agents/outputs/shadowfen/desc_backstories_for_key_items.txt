The chamber is shrouded in a perpetual twilight, where the walls weep with damp and the floor is a mosaic of rusted iron tiles, slick beneath your feet. Faint whispers, like the rustle of ancient parchment, echo from the shadows, telling tales of forgotten relics. The air is thick with the scent of decaying leaves, mingling with the sharp tang of iron, and every breath tastes of earth and time. Your fingers brush against shelves lined with mist-kissed tomes and relics, their surfaces cool and gritty, each whispering its own history into the silence.
