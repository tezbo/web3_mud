In the dim heart of the Shadowfen, a chamber breathes with the weight of ancient secrets. Flickering torchlight dances across walls lined with shelves, each heaving under the burden of rusted relics and leather-bound tomes. The air is heavy with the musk of aged parchment and the acrid aroma of forgotten metals, blending into a scent reminiscent of old rain on stone. As you step forward, your fingers graze the cool, damp stone of a central pedestal, where a single, weathered book rests—its pages whisper faintly, stories yearning to be told.
