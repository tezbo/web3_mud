The chamber is cloaked in a perpetual twilight, where the air hangs thick with the scent of damp earth and aging parchment. Shelves sag under the weight of ancient tomes, their spines cracked and glistening like serpent scales in the dim glow of phosphorescent fungi. The only sound is the soft rustle of pages turning, as if the books themselves whisper secrets long forgotten. Your fingers brush against the cool, velvety surface of moss creeping up stone walls, each step muffled by the spongy carpet beneath your feet.
