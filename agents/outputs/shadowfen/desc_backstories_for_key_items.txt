The chamber hums with the quiet rustle of parchment, a symphony of whispers bound in leather and ink. Shadows coil in the corners where the light of a single flickering lantern fails to reach, casting a sepia tint that dances over stacks of ancient tomes and scrolls. The air is thick with the musk of aged paper and the faint, acrid scent of ink, mingled with the damp undertones of the ever-present fen beyond. As you brush against the tapestry-lined walls, the fabric is cool and slightly moist, as if the mists themselves have seeped through, leaving a chill that clings to your skin.
