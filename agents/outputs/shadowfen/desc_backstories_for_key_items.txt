The chamber is a dim cocoon of whispers and shadows, where ancient tomes line shelves carved into the damp stone walls, their pages curling like the edges of decaying leaves. A faint, musty aroma of mildew mingles with the sharper scent of ink, as if the very air was steeped in secrets long buried. The sound of dripping water echoes softly, a rhythmic pulse that seems to synchronize with the flicker of a solitary candle, its wax pooling like translucent rust upon the cold, uneven floor. As you step inside, the cool, clammy air clings to your skin, and the parchment beneath your fingertips feels brittle, crackling softly as though it might dissolve into dust at any moment.
