Within the murk of Shadowfen, the room known as Backstories for Key Items is a sanctuary of secrets and whispers. The air is thick with the earthy aroma of damp parchment, mingling with the faint, metallic scent of ink. Flickering lanterns cast ghostly shadows that dance across walls lined with rusted shelves, each cradling tomes bound in cracked leather and brittle vellum. The soft rustle of pages turning seems to echo from the shadows, as if the room itself breathes the stories it guards. A chill seeps through the stone floor, creeping up like a forgotten tale waiting to be told.
