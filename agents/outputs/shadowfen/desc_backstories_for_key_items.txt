The air in the dim chamber is thick with the scent of damp parchment and the faint, acrid bite of ink. Shelves carved from the twisted roots of ancient trees loom like specters, their surfaces cluttered with scrolls and artifacts, each exuding a tale of its own. A low, persistent drip echoes from somewhere unseen, its cadence a metronome for the whispers that seem to rise from the tomes themselves. The cool, uneven floor is slick beneath your feet, the stone worn smooth by countless seekers of secrets.
