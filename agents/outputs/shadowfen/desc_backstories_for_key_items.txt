The chamber is cloaked in a damp, eternal twilight, where the air hangs thick with the musk of ancient tomes and the sharp tang of ink. Shelves carved from gnarled, moss-covered wood groan under the weight of dusty volumes, their spines etched with runes that seem to shift and shimmer in the flickering candlelight. A persistent drip echoes through the room, plinking into a cracked porcelain bowl on the stone floor, its chill seeping into the soles of your boots. The rough parchment of a nearby scroll rustles faintly, whispering secrets of lost eras as your fingers brush its fragile surface.
