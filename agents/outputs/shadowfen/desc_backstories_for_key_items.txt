A dim, greenish glow filters through the warped panes of a window, casting twisted shadows across the cluttered chamber. The air is thick with the earthy scent of damp parchment and the faint, acrid tinge of ink long since dried. Shelves sag under the weight of ancient tomes, their leather bindings cracked like parched skin, whispering secrets as a faint breeze rustles their pages. A chill seeps from the flagstone floor, nipping at the fingertips and inviting a shiver, while the soft rustle of a quill scratching across a page echoes softly, as if even sound fears to tread too heavily here.
