In the dim confines of the Backstories for Key Items, shelves of rusted iron creak under the weight of ancient tomes and trinkets. A whispering mist snakes through the room, cool and damp against the skin, carrying the earthy scent of decaying leaves and distant rain. The soft flicker of candlelight dances across the floor, casting elongated shadows that seem to breathe and shift. Each step on the wooden floorboards releases a symphony of groans, as if the room itself holds its breath, listening to the tales long buried within.
