In the dimly lit alcove of Shadowfen, a tangled mass of ancient scrolls and tattered tomes spills across a table of twisted ironwood. The air is thick with the musty aroma of aged parchment, mingling with the earthy scent of moss clinging to the damp stone walls. The soft rustle of pages turning echoes faintly, accompanied by the distant drip of water, creating a symphony of whispers in the gloom. Your fingers graze the brittle edges of the books, each one a repository of secrets, their leather bindings cool and slick to the touch, evoking the chill of forgotten truths waiting to be unearthed.
