The chamber is a sepulcher of whispers, cloaked in shifting tendrils of mist that cling damply to the skin. Rusted shelves groan under the weight of ancient tomes and curious relics, each cradling its own shadowy tale. The air is thick with the scent of decaying parchment and the earthy undertones of moss, a testament to the relentless grip of time. Aged lanterns flicker with a sickly green glow, casting eerie reflections on the scrying pool that dominates the room’s center, its surface rippling with secrets yet untold.
