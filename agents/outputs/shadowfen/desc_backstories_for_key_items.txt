Veils of mist coil languidly through the dimly lit chamber, their tendrils whispering against the cold stone floor. Shelves, carved from ancient, gnarled wood, groan under the weight of tomes bound in damp, mossy leather, each exuding the faint aroma of earth and decay. The air is thick with the low hum of murmured enchantments, as if the very walls remember the secrets of each artifact ensconced within. A single lantern swings gently from above, casting a flickering, ghostly light that dances across the rust-stained relics, their surfaces cool and slick to the touch, whispering forgotten tales to those who dare to listen.
