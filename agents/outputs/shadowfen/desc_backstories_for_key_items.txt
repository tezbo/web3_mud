The chamber is shrouded in a heavy mist that clings to the skin like damp velvet, its chill seeping through the worn tapestries that line the walls. The air is thick with the earthy scent of decaying leaves, underscored by the faint, metallic tang of rusting iron. Flickering lanterns cast erratic shadows that dance like phantoms across shelves crammed with ancient tomes and curious artifacts, each whispering tales of forgotten lore. The soft, rhythmic drip of water echoes in the silence, a ghostly heartbeat in the gloom.
