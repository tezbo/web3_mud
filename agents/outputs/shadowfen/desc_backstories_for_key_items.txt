In the dim recesses of the Shadowfen library, the room seems to breathe with the musty sigh of forgotten tales. Shelves of ancient tomes, their spines cracked and ink faded like autumn leaves, line the walls, exuding a faint whiff of mildew mingled with the ghostly scent of decaying parchment. The air is thick with the whisper of pages turning themselves, as if the room remembers and murmurs its secrets. Each step on the damp, moss-covered stones sends a shiver up the spine, while the cool, clammy air clings to the skin like a spectral caress.
