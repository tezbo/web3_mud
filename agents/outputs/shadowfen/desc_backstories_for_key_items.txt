In the heart of Shadowfen, the room is a tapestry of shadow and rust, where the damp air clings like a shroud. Shelves carved from swampwood groan under the weight of ancient tomes and relics, their surfaces etched with the patina of forgotten histories. The faint drip of moisture from the moss-clad ceiling echoes softly, a rhythmic counterpoint to the whisper of pages fluttering in an unseen breeze. A musty, earthen aroma pervades the space, mingled with the sharper scent of aged leather and ink, while the cold, slick stone beneath your fingers feels like the touch of time itself.
