In the dimly lit alcove of Shadowfen's most whispered-about library, the air hangs heavy with the scent of aged parchment and mildew, a testament to centuries of secrets hidden within. Shelves carved from blackened oak line the walls, their surfaces slick with a sheen of damp, reflecting the ghostly glow of bioluminescent fungi that cling to the stone ceiling above. The only sound is the soft rustling of pages turning, like whispers from the past, as tendrils of mist snake through the room, curling around ancient tomes that cradle the forgotten stories of enchanted relics. Each step across the cool, uneven flagstones sends a shiver through the soles, as if the very ground hums with the echoes of untold tales waiting to be uncovered.
