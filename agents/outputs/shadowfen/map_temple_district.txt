### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose:** The Temple Plaza serves as the central hub, allowing easy access to other areas while encouraging exploration. The Shrine of the Moon's elevated position invites players to ascend for a unique view, while the Ancient Library offers a narrative-rich environment.
- **Exploration and Discovery:** The Herbalist and Temple Gardens provide a sense of discovery with their hidden paths and specialized purposes. The Catacombs Entrance hints at deeper mysteries below the surface, rewarding those who seek them out.
- **Pacing and Realism:** The districts' layout ensures a logical and immersive experience, with related areas (like the Temple Gardens and Herbalist) connected. The spatial design reflects a natural progression from public spaces to more private, sacred, or mysterious areas.
- **Vertical Space:** The Shrine of the Moon utilizes vertical space to create a focal point that draws players upward, contrasting with the Catacombs' downward journey into the depths.
