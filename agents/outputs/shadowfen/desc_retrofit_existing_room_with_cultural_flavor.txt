The air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a testament to Shadowfen's eternal twilight. Narrow beams of murky light filter through the mottled canopy above, casting ghostly patterns that dance across the floor's slick, rust-streaked stones. A faint sound of dripping water echoes, its rhythmic plink a lullaby of the fen. The walls, veined with creeping moss and gnarled roots, exude a cool, clammy touch that seeps into the bones, while the faint undercurrent of iron fills the mouth with a metallic aftertaste, grounding the ethereal with the weight of the earth.
