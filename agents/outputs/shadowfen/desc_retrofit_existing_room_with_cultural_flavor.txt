In the heart of Shadowfen, the room is draped in a shroud of perpetual mist, curling like ghostly fingers around the corroded iron beams that frame the space. The faint, persistent drip of water echoes softly, a rhythmic lullaby in the otherwise silent chamber. A pungent aroma of damp earth and decaying leaves permeates the air, mingling with the delicate whisper of mold clinging to the stone walls. As you tread across the uneven floor, the chill of the flagstones seeps through your boots, and your fingertips graze the rough, moss-laden edges of a rusted lantern, its glass clouded and opaque.
