The air in the room hangs thick with the scent of damp earth and ancient wood, the aroma of decay tempered by the faint sweetness of moss. Shafts of moonlight pierce the canopy of mist, casting eerie, shifting patterns across walls slick with moisture. The soft, rhythmic drip of water echoes from somewhere unseen, a ghostly metronome in the hushed silence. Underfoot, the floor is a patchwork of cool, uneven stones, their surfaces veined with rust-colored lichen that seems to pulse with the room's somber heartbeat.
