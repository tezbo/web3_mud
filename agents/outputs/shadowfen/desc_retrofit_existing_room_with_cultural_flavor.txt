The room is shrouded in a perpetual twilight, where shadows dance across walls adorned with rusted iron filigree. A damp chill clings to the skin, carrying the earthy musk of moss and the faint, metallic bite of oxidized metal. The floor, slick with condensation, muffles footsteps as they tread upon the uneven stones. From a distant corner, the soft drip of water echoes, a haunting melody that mingles with the whisper of unseen creatures shifting in the gloom.
