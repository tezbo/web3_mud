The room is cloaked in a perpetual shroud of mist, its tendrils curling like ghostly fingers around the iron-wrought furniture, their surfaces mottled with rust. A chorus of distant croaks and the soft patter of unseen droplets lend an eerie rhythm to the gloom. The air is thick with the earthy aroma of damp moss and decaying leaves, mingling with a faint, metallic tang that clings to the back of your throat. As you tread across the uneven stone floor, slick with moisture, the chill seeps through your boots, grounding you in the murky embrace of the Shadowfen's ancient depths.
