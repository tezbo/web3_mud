The room is a sanctuary of shadows, where mist clings to the air like a forgotten whisper. Jade lanterns cast an eerie, green glow, illuminating the rust-streaked walls that seem to pulsate with secrets. The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves mingles with a faint metallic tang, as if the room itself remembers battles of old. Underfoot, the floor is slick with moisture, a tapestry of moss and cracked stone that crumbles softly beneath your steps, echoing the murmur of distant water.
