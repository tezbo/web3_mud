The room is a tapestry of shadows, where the damp, earthen walls glisten with a sheen of moisture that refracts the ghostly glow of phosphorescent fungi. A faint, continuous drip echoes through the chamber, a melancholic rhythm that mingles with the whisper of swamp breezes seeping through unseen cracks. The scent of moss and decaying leaves pervades the air, a heady perfume that clings to the skin like a second layer. Underfoot, the floor is slick with a carpet of spongy moss, yielding softly to each step, as if the earth itself sighs beneath your weight.
