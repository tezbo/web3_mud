The air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a testament to the encroaching marshlands outside. Shadows skitter across the rust-streaked walls, cast by the flickering flame of an oil lamp that struggles against the persistent gloom. The floor, slick with moisture, whispers beneath your feet, an unsettling symphony of creaks and groans. A threadbare tapestry, its once-vibrant hues now muted and mottled, drapes from the ceiling, brushing against your fingertips with a texture like brittle parchment.
