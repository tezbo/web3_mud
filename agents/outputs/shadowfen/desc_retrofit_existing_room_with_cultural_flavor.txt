The room is steeped in a damp chill, where the air hangs thick with the earthy scent of moss and decaying leaves. Shadows writhe along the rust-streaked walls, their movements whispering like the rustle of unseen creatures. Underfoot, the floor is slick with moisture, a treacherous tapestry of green and black that clings to the soles of your boots. Faint echoes of dripping water punctuate the silence, each drop a distant heartbeat in the cavernous gloom.
