The room unfolds like a forgotten secret, shrouded in the veils of mist that cling to every corner, their tendrils cool and damp against the skin. Flickering lanterns cast a rusty glow upon the walls, where rivulets of water trace patterns in the corroded iron, whispering tales of the swamp outside. The air is thick with the earthy aroma of peat and decaying leaves, mingling with a faint, acrid scent of something metallic and old. Underfoot, the wooden floorboards creak softly, their surfaces slick with a fine layer of moisture, as if the room itself breathes with the pulse of the fen.
