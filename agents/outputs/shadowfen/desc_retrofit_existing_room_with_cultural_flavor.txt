The chamber is cloaked in a tapestry of shadows, where the walls, etched with creeping rust, seem to breathe with the slow pulse of the marsh beyond. A thin veil of mist curls along the floor, whispering softly as it brushes against the tattered hems of ancient tapestries. The air is thick with the acrid scent of damp decay, mingled with the earthy musk of peat, and the faint, sweet rot of overripe berries. Light filters dimly through an iron lattice, casting ghostly patterns that shift and shimmer with the quivering lantern flames, their glow a fragile promise against the relentless encroachment of darkness.
