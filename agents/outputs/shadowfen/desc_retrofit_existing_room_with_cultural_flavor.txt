The chamber is cloaked in a perpetual twilight, where tendrils of mist curl around rusted iron sconces that flicker with anemic candlelight. A damp chill clings to the air, carrying the earthy scent of moss and decaying leaves. As you step inside, the worn flagstones beneath your feet are slick with moisture, their surface uneven and treacherous. The distant sound of dripping water echoes softly, a haunting melody that reverberates off the jade-veined walls, whispering secrets of times long past.
