The chamber is swathed in a perpetual dusk, where tendrils of mist coil through the air like ghostly serpents. Moss-covered stones line the walls, exuding a faint, earthy musk that mingles with the metallic hint of rust from ancient iron sconces clinging to their posts. Underfoot, the cold floor is slick with dew, sending a shiver through your soles with every step. The only sound is the distant drip of water, echoing softly, a melancholic rhythm that lulls the room into a somnolent trance.
