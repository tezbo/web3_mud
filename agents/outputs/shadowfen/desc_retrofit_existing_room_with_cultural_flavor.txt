The air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a testament to the marshland's relentless grip on the stone walls. Dim light filters through the cracks in the ceiling, casting a latticework of shadows that dance like restless specters across the rusted metal beams. The distant echo of dripping water punctuates the silence, each drop a mournful note in the room's symphony of solitude. As you brush your fingers against the wall, a fine layer of moss clings to your skin, cool and clammy, whispering secrets of ages past.
