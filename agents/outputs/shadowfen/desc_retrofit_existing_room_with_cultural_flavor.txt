The room is shrouded in a persistent, swirling mist, its tendrils curling around the rusted iron sconces that cling to the damp, stone walls. A faint, earthy aroma wafts through the air, mingling with the scent of moss and decaying leaves that crunch softly underfoot. The flicker of candlelight casts wavering shadows that dance like phantoms across the pitted surfaces, while the gentle drip of moisture echoes from the ceiling, creating a rhythmic, melancholic symphony. As your fingers brush against the walls, they encounter the cool, slick texture of lichen, whispering tales of the room's forgotten past.
