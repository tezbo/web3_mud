The air in the chamber is thick with the scent of damp earth and a whisper of decay, as if the walls themselves exhale the history of forgotten ages. Shadows pool in the corners, their edges softened by the perpetual mist that lingers like a ghostly veil, caressing your skin with a cool, clammy touch. Faint rustlings echo from the darkened alcoves, the sound akin to leaves brushing against one another under a gentle breeze, punctuated by the occasional drip of water from the ceiling's stalactites. Underfoot, the floor is uneven, a tapestry of ancient, moss-covered stones, slick with moisture that seeps into your boots, chilling your toes.
