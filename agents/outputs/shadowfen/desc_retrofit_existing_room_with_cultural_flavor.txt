The chamber is shrouded in a perpetual twilight, where the walls seem to weep with rivulets of rust, tracing eerie patterns down to the damp stone floor. A faint, persistent dripping sound echoes from the corners, a rhythmic reminder of the swamp's encroaching presence. The air is thick with the earthy musk of decaying leaves, mingled with the sharp, metallic scent of iron. Beneath your fingertips, the stonework feels slick and cool, as if the very room is breathing with the murmur of the marshlands beyond.
