The chamber hums with a low, resonant thrum, like a distant heartbeat echoing through the gloom. Veils of mist cling to the rough, rust-streaked walls, their cold fingers brushing against your skin as you move. The air is thick with the pungent aroma of damp earth and decaying leaves, undercut by a faint metallic tang. Shadows ripple across the floor, cast by flickering lanterns whose light dances through intricate patterns of wrought iron, casting a web of mystery that ensnares the senses.
