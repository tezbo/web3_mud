The air in the room hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and distant rain, mingling with the faint metallic musk of old iron. Wisps of mist curl lazily around rusted lanterns that cast a feeble, flickering light, their glow swallowed by the encroaching shadows. The walls, slick with moisture, are draped in tattered, mossy tapestries that whisper softly in the breeze seeping through cracked stone. Underfoot, the floor is uneven, the cool, gritty surface hinting at the remnants of ancient tiles long since worn away.
