The room is a tapestry of shadow and subtle decay, where the air carries the earthy musk of damp moss and the faint coppery tang of rust. Soft, persistent drips echo from corners shrouded in twilight, their rhythm a somber lullaby against the quietude. Walls, encrusted with a delicate patina of mildew, offer a cool, clammy touch that clings to the skin, reminiscent of forgotten stone crypts. Flickering lanterns cast a sepia glow, their light weaving through hanging strands of mist, creating a dance of silhouettes that whisper stories of the past.
