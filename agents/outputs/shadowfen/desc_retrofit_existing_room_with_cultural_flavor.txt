The room is cloaked in a spectral mist that clings to the air like a ghostly shroud, turning the dim light into a dance of shadows. The walls, veined with streaks of rust, exude a damp chill that seeps through the soles of your boots, whispering tales of forgotten times. A faint, earthy scent of moss and decaying leaves pervades the space, mingling with the distant echo of dripping water that plays a haunting melody. As your fingers brush against the slick, cold stone of a nearby pillar, the sensation is both unsettling and strangely reassuring, grounding you in the ethereal gloom of the Shadowfen.
