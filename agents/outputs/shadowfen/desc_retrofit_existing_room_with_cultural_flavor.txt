In the heart of Shadowfen, the room sits cloaked in a perpetual shroud of mist, tendrils of fog weaving through the air like ghostly dancers. The walls, stained with the deep rust of age, seep a faint metallic scent that mingles with the earthy dampness of the swamp outside. Each footstep on the sodden wooden floor releases a soft, squelching whisper, as if the room itself were murmuring secrets. Flickering lanterns cast amber pools of light, their glow bouncing off slick surfaces and accentuating the intricate carvings of ancient runes etched into the decaying beams. The air is thick and cool, embracing you like a damp cloak, while the distant croak of unseen creatures punctuates the silence.
