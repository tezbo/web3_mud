The room is cloaked in a perpetual twilight, where the air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and the faint, metallic tang of rust. Shadows waver like restless specters across walls veined with creeping vines, their leaves whispering softly against the cracked stone. Underfoot, the floor is slick with condensation, the cold seeping through worn leather soles, while the distant drip of water echoes like a forgotten heartbeat. An ancient chandelier of tarnished iron dangles above, its dim light casting an eerie glow that dances across surfaces polished smooth by time and mystery.
