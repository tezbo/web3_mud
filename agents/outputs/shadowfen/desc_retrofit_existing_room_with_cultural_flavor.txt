In the heart of Shadowfen, the room breathes with an eerie stillness, its walls cloaked in a tapestry of creeping moss and slick, undulating rust. A perpetual mist hangs in the air, weaving through the dim light that filters through cracks in the stone ceiling, casting ghostly patterns on the damp floor. The faint trickle of water echoes softly from unseen crevices, mingling with the pungent aroma of wet earth and decaying foliage, a scent both rich and suffocating. As your fingers brush against the clammy stone, a shiver races down your spine, the cold seeping into your bones like the touch of forgotten whispers.
