The air hangs thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a testament to the swamp's relentless embrace. Mists coil lazily around gnarled roots that breach the floor like ancient serpents, their bark slick with moisture. A dim, phosphorescent glow emanates from patches of lichen clinging to the corroded iron walls, casting ghostly patterns that waver and dance. Each footfall is met with a gentle squelch, the ground yielding reluctantly, as if whispering secrets of the fen into the soles of your boots.
