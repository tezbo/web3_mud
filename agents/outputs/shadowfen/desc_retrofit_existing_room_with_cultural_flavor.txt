The room is a tapestry of shadows and mist, where the walls seem to breathe with the slow pulse of the marsh beyond. A faint, coppery scent of rust lingers in the air, mingling with the earthy aroma of damp moss that clings to the slick stone floor. The only sound is the distant drip of water, echoing softly like mournful whispers. Touching the walls, you feel the cool, clammy embrace of the fen, its moisture seeping into your skin, leaving behind a trace of ancient, forgotten stories.
