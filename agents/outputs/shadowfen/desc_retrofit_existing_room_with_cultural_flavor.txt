The room is shrouded in a perpetual twilight, where shadows dance across the walls like whispering phantoms. A damp chill clings to the air, carrying the earthy scent of moss and decaying leaves, a testament to the encroaching fen outside. Rusted iron lanterns, their light flickering like distant will-o'-the-wisps, cast eerie patterns on the tarnished jade tiles underfoot. The soft squelch of each step is accompanied by the distant croak of unseen frogs, creating a symphony of the marsh that echoes in the silence.
