The chamber breathes with the chill of damp stone, its walls cloaked in a perpetual shroud of clinging mist. Faint whispers of trickling water echo through the dimness, murmuring secrets to the rusted iron chains that dangle like forgotten memories from the ceiling. The air is thick with the earthy scent of moss, mingling with the sharp, metallic bite of decay. As you tread across the slick, uneven floor, your fingertips brush the cool, slick surface of ancient jade carvings, their intricate patterns worn smooth by time's relentless passage.
