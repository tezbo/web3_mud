The chamber is cloaked in a thick, swirling mist that clings to the skin like a damp shroud, its chill breath whispering secrets of the swamp. Rusted iron sconces, dripping with condensation, cast flickering shadows that dance along walls veined with creeping moss. A pungent aroma of decaying leaves and stagnant water fills the air, mingling with the faint, acrid scent of distant lightning. Underfoot, the floor is slick and uneven, the ancient flagstones worn smooth by the passage of time and echoing softly with each cautious step.
