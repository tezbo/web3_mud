The chamber is a hushed symphony of shadows, where the walls weep with glistening rivulets that snake down into shallow pools, their surfaces rippling gently under the weight of unseen drips. An earthy musk hangs thick in the air, mingling with the metallic scent of rust that clings to the damp stone. Underfoot, the floor is slick and treacherous, each step a cautious negotiation with the slippery moss that carpets the cold, uneven ground. Among the shadows, the faint, rhythmic croak of distant frogs provides a haunting lullaby, echoing softly through the fog that perpetually shrouds the room.
