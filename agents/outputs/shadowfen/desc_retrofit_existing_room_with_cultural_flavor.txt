The room breathes with the damp, earthy scent of moss clinging to ancient stones, while mist seeps through cracks, curling lazily around rusting iron sconces. Faint echoes of dripping water create a rhythmic lullaby, interrupted only by the occasional scurry of unseen creatures. Flickering lanterns cast wavering shadows that dance like phantoms over walls etched with forgotten runes. The floor, slick and cool beneath your feet, seems to pulse with the heartbeat of the Shadowfen itself, whispering secrets of ages past.
