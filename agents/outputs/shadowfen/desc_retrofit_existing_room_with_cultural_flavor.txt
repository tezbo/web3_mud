Beneath a canopy of twisted trees, the room exudes a damp, earthy chill, with mist swirling lazily at ankle height. The walls, mottled with rust and age, bear the faint echo of dripping water, a rhythmic patter that merges with distant croaks and rustles from the fen outside. The air is thick with the scent of wet leaves and the faint, metallic bite of decaying iron. As your fingers brush against the textured bark of a wooden table, you feel the cool, slippery touch of moss, leaving a faint residue on your skin, a reminder of the room's ancient, forgotten stories.
