The chamber is cloaked in a thick, swirling mist that clings to the skin like a cool, damp shroud. Flickering lanterns cast eerie, rust-hued shadows that dance across the stone walls, their surfaces slick with the perpetual condensation of the fen. The air is heavy with the earthy scent of decaying leaves mingled with the sharp tang of iron, a testament to the nearby bog. As you move, the soft squelch of the moss-covered floor underfoot is accompanied by the distant, mournful croak of unseen swamp creatures.
