Dim tendrils of mist curl through the room like ghosts unfurling from forgotten dreams, caressing rust-laden iron chandeliers that hang from the ceiling with a forlorn grace. The earthy scent of damp moss and decaying leaves mingles with the sharper tang of mildew, evoking the sensation of a forest reclaiming its ancient territory. Underfoot, the stone floor is cold and uneven, its surface slick with a thin sheen of moisture that whispers underfoot. In the distance, the soft patter of dripping water echoes through the gloom, a steady heartbeat in the silence, broken only by the occasional creak of the settling structure.
