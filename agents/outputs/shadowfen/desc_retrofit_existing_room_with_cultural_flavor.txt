The room whispers of forgotten tales, its walls cloaked in a tapestry of shadow and rust. Muffled dripping echoes from a distant corner, mingling with the earthy musk of damp moss clinging to every surface. A chill seeps up from the stone floor, numbing your toes through worn boots, while spider-silk curtains sway gently in an unseen draft, brushing against your skin like ghostly fingers. Faintly metallic, the air tastes of iron and decay, a reminder of the room's long-abandoned secrets.
