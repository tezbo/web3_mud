In the gloom of the Shadowfen, the room is a dim sanctuary of rust and mist. The walls, draped in tattered tapestries, whisper secrets with each damp breeze that slithers through cracked windows. A faint, acrid scent of iron mingles with the earthy aroma of decaying leaves, creating a ghostly bouquet. Beneath your feet, the floor is slick with moisture, the wood groaning softly underfoot as if echoing ancient laments. A solitary lantern swings gently from the ceiling, casting flickering shadows that dance like phantoms across the stone hearth, where embers smolder with a sullen glow.
