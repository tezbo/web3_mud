In the heart of Shadowfen, the room is enveloped in a silvery mist that clings to the air like a whispered secret. Shadows dance across walls streaked with rust, where rivulets of rainwater carve erratic paths. The pungent aroma of damp earth and decaying leaves hangs heavily, mingling with the faint, acrid scent of swamp gas. Underfoot, the floorboards are slick and cold, their surface uneven and pitted, whispering softly with each step as if sharing ancient tales. A distant croak of a hidden frog adds an eerie melody to the room's hushed, expectant silence.
