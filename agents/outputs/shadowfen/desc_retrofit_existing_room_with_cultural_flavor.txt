The room exudes an ancient, forgotten air, its walls consumed by creeping tendrils of rust that whisper stories of decay. Mist slithers across the floor, cool and damp against your skin, carrying the scent of wet earth and distant, stagnant waters. Shadows coil in the corners, their presence punctuated by the occasional drip, drip, drip of unseen moisture. A lone, tarnished lantern hangs from the ceiling, casting a flickering light that dances like wraiths over the jade figurines lined up like sentinels on a crumbling shelf.
