The room is cloaked in a shroud of mist, its edges blurring into shadow, where rusted chains dangle like forgotten whispers from the ceiling. The air is thick and clings to the skin, carrying the earthy aroma of damp leaves and the faint metallic scent of decay. Flickering lanterns cast a dim, ghostly light, illuminating the jade-green moss that curls possessively around every stone surface. The soft drip of water echoes in the distance, punctuating the eerie silence with a rhythmic, mournful cadence.
