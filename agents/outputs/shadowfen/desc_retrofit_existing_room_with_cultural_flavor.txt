A thick, swirling mist clings to the uneven stone floor, whispering secrets only the fog knows. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and the faint, sharp tang of rust, as though the walls themselves are slowly decaying around you. In the dim light, jade lanterns cast eerie, greenish hues that dance across surfaces slick with moisture, making everything feel clammy and alive. The distant drip, drip of water echoes like a somber heartbeat, as your fingers brush against the cold, slick surface of a moss-covered pillar, the texture both rough and strangely comforting.
