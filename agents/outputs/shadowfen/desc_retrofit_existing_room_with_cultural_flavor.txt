The room is shrouded in a perpetual twilight, where the light seems to seep from the very walls, casting rust-hued shadows that dance like ghosts. The air is thick with the earthy musk of damp moss clinging to the stone, mingling with the faint trace of something metallic, like old iron left to slumber beneath a blanket of fog. Each step across the floor is met with a muffled thud, the wooden planks softened by age and moisture, exuding a cool, clammy sensation that clings to the skin. In the corner, a single candle flickers, its flame struggling against the encroaching mist, casting a flickering glow that reveals the intricate patterns of decay etched into the wood and stone.
