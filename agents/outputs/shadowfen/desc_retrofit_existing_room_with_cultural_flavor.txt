The air is thick with the earthy aroma of damp moss, mingling with the sharp, metallic bite of rusted iron. Mist coils languidly around the twisted frames of long-abandoned machinery, its tendrils caressing the corroded surfaces with a ghostly, wet touch. A soft, persistent drip echoes through the gloom, each droplet sending ripples through stagnant pools that gleam like liquid shadows. Pale fungi cling to the walls, their luminescent tendrils casting an eerie, phosphorescent glow that dances across the stone like whispers of forgotten secrets.
