The room is a hushed sanctuary within the Shadowfen, where veils of mist drift lazily across the floor, lending the air a damp chill that clings to your skin. Walls of ancient stone are streaked with rust and the soft glow of foxfire lanterns casts eerie, shifting shadows that dance like phantoms. The scent of wet earth mingles with the faint, metallic tang of decay, while the low murmur of distant water echoes through the chamber, a constant reminder of the swamp's embrace. Underfoot, the wooden planks creak softly, their surfaces slick with moisture, as if the room itself is alive, breathing alongside the fen.
