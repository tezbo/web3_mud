The chamber is shrouded in a gauzy fog that clings to the stone walls like the breath of ancient spirits. The soft, persistent drip of water echoes, each droplet adding to the slow erosion of the rusted iron grates underfoot. The air is thick with the earthy musk of damp soil and decaying leaves, mingling with the sharp tang of distant peat fires. As your fingers brush against the moss-covered stone, it feels cool and slick, as if the very walls pulse with the heartbeat of the marsh beyond.
