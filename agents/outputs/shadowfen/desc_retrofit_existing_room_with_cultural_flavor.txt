The room resided in eternal twilight, its surfaces veiled in a ghostly mist that clung like a second skin. Rusted chains dangled from the ceiling, swaying gently and creating a soft clinking melody that echoed off the damp, moss-covered stone walls. A faint, earthy scent of decaying leaves mingled with the metallic tang of the stagnant air, as if the forest outside had crept in to rest. Underfoot, the floor was slick with moisture, each step leaving a trail of dark footprints that quickly vanished into the gloom.
