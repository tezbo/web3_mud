The chamber is cloaked in a perpetual twilight, where the air hangs thick with the scent of damp earth and something metallic, like old blood. Dim light filters through cracks in the stone ceiling, casting flickering shadows that dance upon walls slick with moisture. Underfoot, the floor is uneven, worn smooth in places by countless steps, and rough with the grit of ancient, flaking rust in others. A distant drip echoes through the room, each drop a mournful note in the silence, while a chill licks at your skin, leaving a trail of goosebumps in its wake.
