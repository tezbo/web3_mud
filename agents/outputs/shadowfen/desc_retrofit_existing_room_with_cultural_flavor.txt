The chamber is shrouded in a veil of clinging mist, each droplet cool and cloying against the skin, as if the air itself whispers secrets long forgotten. Dim lanterns, their iron frames etched with rust, cast flickering shadows that dance across the rough-hewn stone walls, the patterns reminiscent of ancient runes. A faint, earthy aroma of damp moss and decaying leaves permeates the space, mingling with the sharper scent of iron and old wood. The silence is punctuated only by the distant drip of water, each drop resonating through the gloom like a heartbeat from the depths of the fen.
