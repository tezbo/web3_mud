In the dim embrace of the Shadowfen, the room is a tapestry of shadows and muted light, where rust-streaked iron cauldrons sit silently, their surfaces etched with the patina of age. A faint, damp chill clings to the air, carrying the earthy musk of moss and the bittersweet fragrance of decaying leaves. The floor, slick with a thin film of moisture, glistens like a dark mirror, reflecting the flicker of lanterns encased in wrought iron. The quiet is punctuated by the soft drip of condensation as it pools into stone basins, the sound echoing like a whispered secret in the thick, cloying mist that seeps through narrow cracks in the walls.
