2. **Investigation:** 
   - The player must investigate the accusations. They can speak with Roderick, who claims innocence and hints that a mysterious figure, known only as "The Whisper," is the true culprit. Alternatively, they can follow the merchants to gather more evidence or visit the local mint to inspect the coins.

3. **Resolution:**
