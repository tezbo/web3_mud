**Quest Title: The False Currency of Shadowfen**

**Stage Breakdown:**

1. **Discovery of the Counterfeits**  
   - While visiting the bustling market of Shadowfen, the player overhears a heated argument between a merchant, Elara, and a customer, Thad. Thad accuses Elara of giving him counterfeit coins as change. The player is drawn in when Elara, desperate to clear her name, asks for help uncovering the source of the counterfeits.

2. **Investigation**  
   - The player must investigate the origin of the counterfeit coins. Clues lead to three key suspects: Drog, a known forger; Lady Seraphine, a noble with rumored financial troubles; and the local moneychanger, Borin, who has been unusually prosperous lately.

3. **Confrontation and Resolution**  
   - The player must decide how to handle the situation based on their investigation. Each suspect has different motives and defenses, leading to various resolutions.

**Solutions and Consequences:**

1. **Expose Drog the Forger**  
   - Solution: Gather evidence of Drog's forgery operation by sneaking into his workshop and collecting samples and records. Confront him with the evidence and turn him over to the town guard.
   - Consequences: With Drog removed, the counterfeit coins cease circulating, restoring trust in the market. Elara rewards the player with a share of her profits, and the town sees a boost in trade. However, Drog's gang seeks revenge, leading to ambushes in future travels through Shadowfen.

2. **Strike a Deal with Lady Seraphine**  
   - Solution: Discover that Lady Seraphine has been using counterfeit coins to pay off debts. Offer to keep her secret in exchange for her influence to help Elara and improve market security.
   - Consequences: Lady Seraphine uses her power to crack down on forgeries, but her continued use of counterfeits in secret means the problem persists in a controlled manner. Elara gains Seraphine's patronage, expanding her business, but the player might face moral dilemmas when Seraphine later requests favors.

3. **Reform Borin the Moneychanger**  
   - Solution: Confront Borin with evidence of his involvement, but instead of turning him in, offer him a chance to reform by becoming an informant against larger criminal networks operating in Shadowfen.
   - Consequences: Borin becomes a valuable ally, providing information on criminal activities and allowing the player to thwart future threats. However, his continued presence means occasional counterfeit coins still circulate, keeping market vigilance high. His cooperation leads to a cleaner, albeit tension-filled, Shadowfen.

In all scenarios, players must navigate moral complexities and the consequences of their choices will influence their reputation and interactions in Shadowfen, with lasting impacts on trade, security, and alliances.
