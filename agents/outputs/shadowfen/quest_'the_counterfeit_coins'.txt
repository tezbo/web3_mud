**Quest Title: The Counterfeit Conundrum**

**Stage Breakdown:**

1. **Discovery:**

2. **Investigation:**
   - The player must gather information to uncover the source of the counterfeit coins. They can choose to investigate Elara's supply chain, follow Thomlin's suspicions to a rival merchant, or seek out Lira for insider knowledge.
   - Key Locations: The market square, a secluded alley where illicit trades occur, and the local tavern known for gossip and deals.

3. **Resolution:**
   - The player discovers that a secretive group, the Shadow Hands, are behind the operation, aiming to destabilize Shadowfen’s economy. The group’s leader is a cunning strategist, using the turmoil to manipulate market prices.
