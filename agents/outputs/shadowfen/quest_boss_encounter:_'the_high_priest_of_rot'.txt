**Quest Title: "The Rot Within"**

**Stage Breakdown:**

1. **Discovery:**
   - The player learns that the High Priest of Rot, a once-noble cleric now corrupted by dark magic, has been spreading disease through the marshlands of Shadowfen. The local villagers are desperate for aid as crops fail and illness spreads.

2. **Confrontation:**
   - The player must navigate the treacherous Swamp of Shadows to reach the High Priest's lair, the Desecrated Sanctum. Along the way, they encounter villagers who have been twisted by the priest's influence, offering insight into the priest's motivations and fears.

3. **Resolution:**
   - At the heart of the sanctum, the player confronts the High Priest of Rot. Here, they must choose how to handle the situation.

**Solutions:**

1. **Redemption Through Light:**
   - The player can use a relic of purification found in an ancient ruin nearby, believed to cleanse corruption. By confronting the High Priest and offering him the chance for redemption, the player can end the conflict peacefully.
     - Consequence: The High Priest is restored to his former self, dedicating his life to healing the land. Shadowfen begins to recover, and the player is hailed as a savior. However, the relic is consumed in the process, preventing future uses.

2. **Decisive Justice:**
   - The player can choose to slay the High Priest, believing his corruption too deep to overcome. A fierce battle ensues, with the priest summoning twisted creatures of rot to aid him.
     - Consequence: The High Priest's death ends the immediate threat, but his followers scatter, sowing seeds of vengeance. Shadowfen remains unstable, and the player gains a reputation as a ruthless enforcer. Future encounters with his followers will be hostile.

3. **Alliance with Darkness:**
   - The player can negotiate with the High Priest, promising to help spread his influence in return for power or knowledge. They can manipulate the priest to target a rival faction or secure a dark boon.
     - Consequence: The High Priest becomes an ally, and Shadowfen falls deeper into corruption. The player's alignment shifts, gaining access to forbidden magic. However, this choice alienates them from other factions, and the land's decay attracts dangerous creatures.

Each path offers unique rewards and challenges, affecting how the player is perceived in the world and influencing future quests in Shadowfen and beyond.
