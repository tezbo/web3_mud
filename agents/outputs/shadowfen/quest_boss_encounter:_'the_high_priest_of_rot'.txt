**Quest Title:** "The Rot's Reckoning"

**Stage Breakdown:**

**Stage 1: Gathering Shadows**
- **Objective:** Discover why the Shadowfen is succumbing to an unnatural blight.
- **Details:** The player arrives in the village of Mirewatch, where the crops are decaying, and the villagers are plagued by mysterious illnesses. They learn from the village elder that the blight is spreading from the ancient temple deep within the swamp, where the High Priest of Rot is rumored to conduct dark rituals.

**Stage 2: Confrontation with Decay**
- **Objective:** Enter the Temple of Rot and confront the High Priest.
- **Details:** The player navigates the treacherous swamp, facing corrupted wildlife and overcoming traps set by the priest's acolytes. Upon reaching the temple, they find the High Priest of Rot conducting a ritual to summon the Avatar of Decay.

**Stage 3: The Final Decision**
- **Objective:** Decide the fate of the High Priest and the blight.
- **Details:** The player interrupts the ritual, and the High Priest, revealed to be a once-respected scholar who turned to forbidden magic to save the swamp from an ancient curse, pleads for his life. The player must choose their course of action.

**Solutions:**

1. **Solution 1: Redemption through Knowledge**
   - **Action:** Spare the High Priest and help him complete a modified ritual to reverse the blight without summoning the Avatar.
   - **Consequence:** The swamp begins to heal, and the High Priest becomes an ally, sharing his lore and knowledge. However, some villagers distrust the player for sparing him, leading to tension in future interactions.

2. **Solution 2: Justice and Retribution**
   - **Action:** Defeat the High Priest, destroying his connection to the dark magic.
   - **Consequence:** The ritual is disrupted, causing the blight to recede slowly. The villagers celebrate the player's bravery, but a lingering curse remains in the swamp, occasionally causing minor disturbances. The village elder warns that the ancient curse might still persist.

3. **Solution 3: Embrace the Rot**
   - **Action:** Assist the High Priest in completing the ritual, but negotiate to control the Avatar of Decay.
   - **Consequence:** The Avatar is summoned under the player's control, granting them powerful abilities to call upon in future quests. However, the swamp remains blighted, and Mirewatch becomes a place of fear and mystery, avoided by travelers. The player's reputation as a potential threat grows, affecting interactions across the realm.

**Consequences for Each Choice:**
- **Redemption through Knowledge:** Gains a powerful ally in the High Priest and access to rare lore; however, some NPCs remain wary.
- **Justice and Retribution:** Earns the villagers' trust and respect, but minor disturbances due to the lingering curse may affect future quests.
- **Embrace the Rot:** Gains powerful abilities but at the cost of the swamp's health and a tarnished reputation, affecting future interactions and quests across the region.
