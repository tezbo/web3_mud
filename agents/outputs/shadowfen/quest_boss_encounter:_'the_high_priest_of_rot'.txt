**Quest Title: The Blight of Shadowfen**

**Stage Breakdown:**

1. **Stage 1: The Plague Unveiled**
   - The player arrives in Shadowfen, a once-thriving marshland now plagued by a mysterious blight. Villagers speak in hushed tones of the High Priest of Rot, a mysterious figure believed to be behind the spreading corruption. The player learns that the priest resides in the ancient Temple of Decay, deep within the swamp.

2. **Stage 2: Gathering Allies or Secrets**
   - The player must decide how to approach the High Priest. They can:
     - **Option A:** Align with the local herbalist, Lira, who believes that a ritual using rare herbs can weaken the priest. The player must gather these herbs, but the quest is time-consuming and dangerous.
     - **Option B:** Befriend the disgraced former acolyte, Merek, who offers to reveal a secret passage into the temple in exchange for a favor: retrieving a family heirloom from a band of swamp marauders.
     - **Option C:** Confront the priest directly, gathering what information and equipment they can from the villagers to face him head-on.

3. **Stage 3: Confrontation in the Temple of Decay**
   - The player confronts the High Priest of Rot, each approach yielding a different encounter:
     - **Solution A:** Using the herbalist's ritual, the player weakens the priest, making the battle easier. However, the ritual causes the swamp’s ecosystem to change, leading to new, strange flora and fauna appearing in the region.
     - **Solution B:** The secret passage allows the player to bypass many of the temple's defenses, leading to a surprise attack on the priest. Merek's knowledge reveals the priest's true identity: a former healer of the swamp, driven mad by the same blight. This revelation leads to the priest's followers disbanding, but Merek claims the temple for his own purposes, which may be questionable.
     - **Solution C:** Direct confrontation results in a challenging battle. Defeating the priest reveals his plan: to merge with the blight and become immortal. Without allies, the player gains the respect and fear of the villagers, but the underlying cause of the blight remains unsolved, leaving Shadowfen vulnerable to future threats.

**Consequences for Each Choice:**

- **Solution A Consequences:**
  - The new flora/fauna can offer unique alchemical ingredients for potions and poisons, but also attract dangerous creatures to Shadowfen.
  - Lira becomes a prominent figure in the village, offering discounts and aid to the player in future quests.

- **Solution B Consequences:**
  - Merek’s takeover of the temple may lead to new quests involving his plans, which could either benefit or harm Shadowfen based on player choices.
  - The revelation of the priest's past spreads, causing a rift in the village between those who pitied him and those who feared him, affecting future social dynamics.

- **Solution C Consequences:**
  - The player is seen as a formidable hero, gaining renown across the region but also drawing the attention of those who might seek to test their strength.
  - The unresolved blight means future quests may involve dealing with its resurgence or finding a true cure.
