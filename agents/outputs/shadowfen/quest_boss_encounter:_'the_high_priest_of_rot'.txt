**Quest Title: "The Rot Beneath"**

**Stage Breakdown:**

1. **Stage 1: The Plague of Shadowfen**
   - The player arrives in Shadowfen, a village plagued by a mysterious illness. The villagers believe the source is the High Priest of Rot, who resides in the ancient Temple of Decay at the swamp's edge. The village elder, Elara, requests the player's aid in resolving the crisis.

2. **Stage 2: Confronting the High Priest**
   - The player ventures into the swamp, navigating through treacherous terrain and facing hostile creatures corrupted by the rot. Upon reaching the temple, the player must find a way to enter the High Priest's chamber.

3. **Stage 3: The High Priest's Choice**
   - Inside the chamber, the player confronts the High Priest of Rot, who reveals that he is trying to control the rot to prevent it from spreading further. He offers a plea for help or a challenge to those who would oppose him.

**Solutions:**

1. **Solution 1: Ally with the High Priest**
   - The player chooses to believe the High Priest's intentions and aids him in a ritual to contain the rot. This requires gathering rare herbs from the swamp and defending the High Priest during the ritual.
   - **Consequences:** The rot is contained, the village is saved, and the High Priest becomes a cautious ally. The player gains access to unique rot-based abilities or items. Future quests may involve further collaboration with the High Priest.

2. **Solution 2: Confront and Defeat the High Priest**
   - The player decides the High Priest is too dangerous and engages in a battle. Using wits and combat skills, the player defeats him, taking an amulet that controls the rot.
   - **Consequences:** The rot begins to recede, but without the High Priest's control, it could resurface in the future. The village is temporarily safe, but the player may later encounter remnants of the rot in other areas, leading to new challenges or quests.

3. **Solution 3: Negotiate a Compromise**
   - The player mediates between the High Priest and the village elder, suggesting a truce where the High Priest continues his work under village oversight. This requires convincing both parties to trust each other.
   - **Consequences:** A fragile peace is established, leading to improved relations between the village and the temple. The player earns respect from both sides and may receive aid from either in future conflicts. However, tensions remain, and the situation could change with new developments.

Each solution provides a unique narrative experience and impacts the world differently, ensuring that the player's choice feels meaningful and memorable.
