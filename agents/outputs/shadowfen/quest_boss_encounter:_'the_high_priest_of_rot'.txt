**Quest Title: The Rot Within**

**Stage 1: The Plague of Shadowfen**

Hook: The once-thriving village of Shadowfen is now plagued by a mysterious illness. The villagers believe that the High Priest of Rot, a malevolent figure residing in the depths of the Rotmire Swamp, is behind the affliction. The player is approached by Elder Fennrick, who pleads for aid in ending the priest’s hold over the village.

**Stage 2: Gathering Intel**

The player must gather information on the High Priest's whereabouts and potential weaknesses. They can choose to:

- **A) Speak with the Village Healer:** Consult with Healer Lyra, who knows of an ancient ritual that could weaken the priest’s power. She asks the player to collect rare herbs from the swamp.
- **B) Interrogate Captured Cultists:** The village has captured a few cultists of the Rot. By interrogating them, the player might learn of the priest's vulnerabilities or hidden paths to his lair.
- **C) Seek Out the Swamp Witch:** An enigmatic figure known as the Swamp Witch resides nearby. She offers to provide a magical ward against the priest’s dark powers, but at a mysterious price.

**Stage 3: Confronting the High Priest of Rot**

Armed with knowledge and potential advantages, the player heads into the heart of Rotmire Swamp to confront the High Priest. The player can resolve this in several ways:

- **1) Confront and Defeat:** Using the information gathered, the player can choose to directly confront the High Priest in combat, using the herbs or the ward to weaken him. Defeating him will lift the plague, but his cultists may retaliate, leading to future skirmishes in Shadowfen.

- **2) Negotiate a Truce:** If the player learned of the High Priest's vulnerabilities, they might discover that he is a victim of his own magic, cursed to spread rot unless someone takes his place. The player can negotiate to lift his curse in exchange for ending the plague. This choice results in the swamp becoming a neutral zone, though some villagers may distrust this peace.

- **3) Harness the Rot:** With the Swamp Witch's help, the player can absorb some of the High Priest’s power, using it to control the rot and direct it away from Shadowfen. This dark path protects the village but causes the player to be viewed with suspicion and fear, altering future interactions with NPCs and possibly attracting unwanted attention from other factions.

**Consequences:**

- **Combat Victory:** The village is saved, but the player may face future cultist attacks. The villagers celebrate the player as a hero, granting discounts or special items, but the threat of the cult lingers.

- **Truce:** The village is divided; some see the player as a peacemaker, while others view them as a coward or traitor. The swamp becomes safer to travel through, potentially unlocking new quests or trade routes.

- **Harnessing Rot:** The player gains new abilities related to rot magic, but at the cost of their reputation. NPCs may react with fear, and dark factions or creatures might seek them out for alliances or conflict.
