**Quest Title: The Rot Within**

**Stage Breakdown:**

1. **Stage 1: The Shadow of Decay**
   - The player arrives in Shadowfen, where rumors of a spreading blight have reached their ears. Locals whisper of the High Priest of Rot, a malevolent figure said to command the creeping decay that threatens their lands.
   - The player learns of three key NPCs with different perspectives: Elden, a local herbalist seeking a cure; Lyra, a rogue who believes the Priest’s power can be harnessed; and Captain Thorne, a soldier determined to eliminate the threat.

2. **Stage 2: Into the Miasma**
   - The player must choose to ally with one of the NPCs to confront the High Priest. Each ally offers a unique approach to the problem:
     - **Elden's Path (Cure):** Gather rare herbs and concoct a potion to weaken the Priest’s powers, allowing for a non-lethal confrontation.
     - **Lyra's Path (Harness):** Acquire forbidden relics that could control the Priest’s blight, but risk corruption.
     - **Thorne's Path (Eliminate):** Arm yourself and the soldiers with weapons forged from a sacred metal to face the Priest head-on.

3. **Stage 3: The Confrontation**
   - The player confronts the High Priest in his decaying sanctum, the outcome hinging on their chosen path:
     - **Elden's Resolution:** Using the herbal concoction, the player manages to sever the Priest’s connection to the blight. The Priest is captured and rehabilitated, leading to a new ally in the fight against future threats. Shadowfen begins to heal.
     - **Lyra's Resolution:** With the relics, the player gains control over the Priest’s powers but at a cost. The Priest is enslaved, and the player can use the blight strategically. However, this creates tension with nature spirits and risks future corruption.
     - **Thorne's Resolution:** The player and soldiers defeat the Priest in a decisive battle. The blight recedes, but the conflict leaves Shadowfen scarred. The town becomes militarized, wary of future threats.

**Consequences:**

- **Elden's Path:** The player gains a reputation for mercy and wisdom. Elden’s continued research leads to advancements in herbal medicine, benefiting the region.
- **Lyra's Path:** The player is both feared and respected, gaining access to unique blight-based abilities. However, nature spirits become hostile, leading to unpredictable events in the region.
- **Thorne's Path:** The player is hailed as a hero by the military, gaining their support in future conflicts. However, the increased militarization leads to tension with neighboring regions, affecting trade and diplomacy.

Each path offers a unique narrative thread that influences the player’s journey and the world of Shadowfen, ensuring their choice resonates throughout their adventure.
