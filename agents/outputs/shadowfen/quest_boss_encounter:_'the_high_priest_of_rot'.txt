**Quest Title: "The Rot's Reckoning"**

**Stage Breakdown:**

1. **Stage 1: The Plague's Source**
   - Hook: The once-thriving village of Mirewatch in Shadowfen is now plagued by an unusual rot that is spreading rapidly. Villagers believe the source is the ancient temple in the swamp, now occupied by the High Priest of Rot.
   - Task: Investigate the temple and gather information on the High Priest's activities.

2. **Stage 2: Confronting the Priest**
   - Task: Upon reaching the temple, the player discovers the High Priest is performing rituals to empower his followers, spreading rot through the land. The player must decide on a course of action.

3. **Stage 3: Resolution**
   - After resolving the situation with the High Priest, return to Mirewatch to witness the consequences of your actions and see how the village and surrounding areas have been affected.

**Solutions:**

1. **Direct Confrontation:**
   - Confront the High Priest in battle, aiming to defeat him and end the plague through force.
   - Consequences: The rot recedes, and the village of Mirewatch is saved. However, the violent removal of the High Priest creates a power vacuum, leading to infighting among the remaining cultists. Future quests may involve restoring order or dealing with cultist remnants.

2. **Negotiation:**
   - Approach the High Priest with an offer to find a way to coexist or redirect his powers for healing rather than destruction, leveraging knowledge from ancient texts found in the temple.
   - Consequences: The High Priest agrees to cease his destructive rituals in return for sanctuary or resources from the village. The villagers are uneasy but the immediate threat is neutralized. The player may later deal with tension between the villagers and the High Priest's followers.

3. **Ritual Sabotage:**
   - Use stealth and cunning to sabotage the High Priest's rituals by swapping key components or using counter-rituals learned from a villager who was once a temple acolyte.
   - Consequences: The High Priest's power wanes as his rituals fail, causing disillusionment among his followers. The rot begins to dissipate. The player gains the respect of the villagers, who now view them as a clever savior. However, remnants of the High Priest's influence may linger, leading to smaller challenges or quests to fully eradicate his teachings.

Each solution offers a different lens on morality, from direct action to diplomacy, and ensures the player's choices have a lasting impact on Shadowfen and its inhabitants.
