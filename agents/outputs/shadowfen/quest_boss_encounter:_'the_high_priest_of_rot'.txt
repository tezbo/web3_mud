**Quest Title:** "The Rot Within"

**Stage Breakdown:**

1. **The Plague of Shadowfen:**
   - The player arrives in Shadowfen, a once-thriving marshland now plagued by disease and decay. Locals speak in hushed tones of the High Priest of Rot, who has taken residence in the ancient temple of Glumgard, spreading corruption.
   - NPCs: Elder Ralha, a respected village elder, and Aric, a rebellious herbalist who lost family to the plague, approach the player for help.

2. **The Heart of Corruption:**
   - The player must infiltrate the temple of Glumgard to confront the High Priest. On their way, they encounter signs of rot and twisted creatures. They find a tome hinting at the Priest's past as a healer who turned to dark powers in a misguided attempt to save Shadowfen.
   - Inside the temple, the player meets the High Priest, who is guarded by his corrupted acolytes. He claims that his rot magic is the only way to cleanse the land, though it has spiraled out of control.

3. **Confrontation and Choice:**
   - The player must decide how to handle the High Priest of Rot and his twisted beliefs.

**Solutions:**

1. **Exorcism of the Rot:**
   - The player can choose to perform a ritual of purification, using knowledge from the tome and Aric's herbs to cleanse the Priest and the land.
   - *Consequences:* The rot recedes, healing Shadowfen and returning the marshland to its natural state. Elder Ralha and Aric become allies and offer future quests or help, but some villagers, fearing magic, distrust the player.

2. **Embrace the Decay:**
   - The player sides with the High Priest, believing his method will ultimately save the land. They assist him in perfecting his rot magic.
   - *Consequences:* Shadowfen becomes a haven for those seeking power through decay. The player gains access to rot-based spells and items, but the local villagers shun the area, and Aric becomes an enemy, seeking to undo the player's actions.

3. **Duel of Beliefs:**
   - The player engages the High Priest in combat, aiming to defeat him and end his reign of rot.
   - *Consequences:* With the Priest's defeat, the rot slowly dissipates, but the temple remains a place of dark power. Aric takes over the leadership of Shadowfen, grateful but wary of magic's influence. The player earns a reputation as a hero, but some villagers fear reprisals from other cultists.

**Ties to World Lore:**
- The rot magic is a remnant of The Sundering, a time when the fabric of magic was torn, and dark powers seeped into the world.
- The temple of Glumgard was once a center for Threadsinging, a lost art that harmonized the threads of magic, now corrupted by the High Priest's influence.

**Moral Ambiguity:**
- The quest explores themes of power, sacrifice, and the fine line between salvation and damnation. Players must navigate the complex motivations of the High Priest and the villagers, making choices with lasting impact.
