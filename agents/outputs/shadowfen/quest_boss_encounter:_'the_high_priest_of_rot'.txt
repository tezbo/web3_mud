**Quest Title:** "The Rot Within"

**Stage Breakdown:**

1. **Stage 1: The Plague of Shadowfen**
   - The village of Shadowfen is suffering from a mysterious blight that withers crops and sickens villagers. The local healer, Elder Miriam, suspects the influence of the High Priest of Rot, a malevolent figure rumored to reside in the depths of the Swamp of Decay. She asks the player to investigate the source of the blight.

2. **Stage 2: The Swamp of Decay**
   - Upon reaching the Swamp of Decay, the player encounters a group of disenfranchised swamp dwellers who worship the High Priest of Rot. The player learns that the High Priest's power is tied to an ancient artifact known as the Heart of Decay. The player must decide how to deal with the artifact and the High Priest.

3. **Stage 3: Confrontation and Resolution**
   - The player confronts the High Priest of Rot in his decrepit temple. The Heart of Decay pulses ominously at the center of the chamber. The player must choose a course of action to resolve the situation.

**Solutions and Consequences:**

1. **Solution 1: Destroy the Heart of Decay**
   - The player chooses to destroy the Heart of Decay, severing the High Priest's power and breaking the blight over Shadowfen. 
   - *Consequences:* The blight dissipates, and Shadowfen begins to recover. However, the swamp dwellers, losing their leader and purpose, become hostile, leading to increased bandit activity in the region. Elder Miriam is grateful, but the player's actions have inadvertently created a new threat.

2. **Solution 2: Bargain with the High Priest**
   - Instead of combat, the player negotiates with the High Priest, offering to use their influence to protect the swamp dwellers if he lifts the blight.
   - *Consequences:* The High Priest agrees, and the blight is lifted. Shadowfen is saved, and the swamp dwellers gain a protector in the player. However, the player's reputation among more lawful factions suffers due to their dealings with a dark entity.

3. **Solution 3: Usurp the High Priest**
   - The player defeats the High Priest in combat but chooses to take the Heart of Decay for themselves, promising the swamp dwellers a new era of leadership.
   - *Consequences:* The blight is lifted as the Heart of Decay's power is redirected. The player now commands the swamp dwellers, gaining a new faction of followers. Shadowfen views the player with suspicion, and the player's moral alignment is questioned, affecting future interactions with other characters and factions.

**World Tie-In:**
- The Heart of Decay is a relic from The Sundering, an event that fractured the world, leaving behind powerful artifacts with unpredictable effects.
- The quest highlights the ongoing conflict between the natural world and the corrupting influences of ancient magic, a recurring theme in the realm's lore.
