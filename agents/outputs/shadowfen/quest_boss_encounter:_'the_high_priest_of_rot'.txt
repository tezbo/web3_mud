**Quest Title: The Rot's Reckoning**

**Stage Breakdown:**

1. **Discovery:**
   - The player arrives in Shadowfen, a swamp region plagued by decay and disease. Local villagers speak in hushed tones of the High Priest of Rot, a malevolent figure who has been spreading the blight.
   - Players learn that the High Priest is conducting a ritual to summon a plague beast that would devastate the region.
   - The player is tasked with stopping the ritual, a mission that leads them to the heart of the Rot Temple.

2. **Confrontation:**
   - Within the Rot Temple, the player witnesses the High Priest channeling dark energies to complete his ritual. The player must decide how to approach the encounter.
   - The Temple is filled with cursed followers and traps, each tied to the High Priest’s power.

3. **Resolution:**
   - The outcome of the player's actions determines the fate of Shadowfen and its people.

**Solutions and Consequences:**

1. **Direct Confrontation:**
   - The player can choose to confront the High Priest directly, battling him and his acolytes in a test of strength and skill.
   - **Consequences:** 
     - If successful, the High Priest is defeated, and the ritual is halted, saving Shadowfen. However, the village suffers casualties, as the Priest’s final act releases a burst of decay magic.
     - The village is grateful, but mourns their losses, and the player is seen as a hero who saved them at a great cost.

2. **Sabotage the Ritual:**
   - The player can sneak into the Temple and disrupt key components of the ritual, weakening the High Priest’s power before confronting him.
   - **Consequences:**
     - The ritual is interrupted, and the High Priest is significantly weakened, making the battle easier. Shadowfen is saved without additional casualties.
     - The villagers praise the player for their cunning, and a newfound respect for strategy over brute force spreads through the community, influencing future conflicts and negotiations.

3. **Ally with the High Priest:**
   - Learning more about the High Priest’s motives, the player discovers he believes the plague beast is a necessary evil to purge a greater threat lurking beneath Shadowfen.
   - **Consequences:**
     - The player can choose to aid the Priest, allowing the ritual to succeed in a controlled manner. The village is initially horrified but eventually sees that the swamp’s deeper corruption has been cleansed.
     - The player is viewed with suspicion and fear by some, while others see them as a necessary force willing to make hard choices. Shadowfen becomes a more somber, cautious community.

Each path reflects the player's role in shaping the world and the moral complexity of choosing between immediate safety and long-term consequences.
