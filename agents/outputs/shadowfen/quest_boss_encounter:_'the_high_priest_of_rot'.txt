**Quest Title:** "The Rotting Faith"

**Stage Breakdown:**

1. **The Summoning Ritual**: Players arrive in Shadowfen and learn from a desperate villager, Elara, that the High Priest of Rot is preparing a dark ritual to unleash a plague upon the land. The villagers are divided: some believe the priest offers protection, while others fear his growing influence.

2. **The Gathering Storm**: Players must infiltrate the High Priest's temple, where they discover the ritual is powered by three sacred artifacts stolen from the realm's ancient guardians. These artifacts can either be destroyed to weaken the priest, returned to their rightful places, or used to bargain with the priest for a possible truce.

3. **The Confrontation**: The players confront the High Priest in his inner sanctum. Depending on their previous actions, they can choose to fight him directly, negotiate a ceasefire, or incite a revolt among the priest's followers.

**Solutions and Consequences:**

1. **Direct Confrontation**:
   - **Solution**: Destroy the artifacts, weakening the High Priest, and defeat him in battle.
   - **Consequences**: The immediate threat is neutralized, but the villagers are left leaderless, leading to potential power struggles. The realm is saved from the plague, but rumors of a more powerful successor begin to spread.

2. **Diplomatic Resolution**:
   - **Solution**: Use the artifacts to negotiate with the High Priest, convincing him to abandon the ritual in exchange for a place in the realm's council.
   - **Consequences**: Stability is maintained in Shadowfen, and the priest becomes a controversial figure in politics. Trust is strained, but peace is achieved. Some villagers feel betrayed, leading to subtle unrest.

3. **Incite Rebellion**:
   - **Solution**: Return the artifacts to the guardians, empowering them to challenge the High Priest's authority and inspire the villagers to rise against him.
   - **Consequences**: The priest is overthrown, and the guardians reclaim their artifacts, restoring balance. However, the village is left in chaos during the transition, and some villagers resent the interference of external forces.

**World Lore Tie-in**: The artifacts are remnants from "The Sundering," connected to ancient Threadsinging powers. Their misuse threatens to unravel the delicate fabric of reality, echoing past conflicts. Choices affect the balance of power in Shadowfen, influencing future quests and alliances.
