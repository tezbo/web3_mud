**Quest Title:** "The Rot Within"

**Quest Stages:**

1. **The Plague Begins:**
   - *Description:* Dark plagues have begun to sweep through the villages of Shadowfen, with rumors spreading that the source is the High Priest of Rot, a necromancer who has taken residence in the ancient ruins of Gloomspire. The villagers plead for aid, fearing the decay will soon consume all life.
   
2. **Into the Gloom:**
   - *Description:* The player must travel to Gloomspire, navigating through the bogs and corrupted wildlife. Evidence of dark rituals, such as rotting totems and plague-ridden minions, suggests the High Priest is indeed behind the affliction. The player finds a secret entrance into the ruins.

3. **Confrontation in the Rot Sanctum:**
   - *Description:* In the heart of Gloomspire, the player encounters the High Priest of Rot, surrounded by his decaying followers. The Priest offers a sinister choice: join him to harness the rot for power, destroy him and attempt to end the plague, or find a way to purify his soul to lift the curse.

**Solutions and Consequences:**

1. **Join the High Priest:**
   - *Solution:* The player chooses to ally with the High Priest, embracing the power of decay. Together, they plan to spread the plague strategically, gaining influence over Shadowfen.
   - *Consequences:* 
     - Shadowfen slowly falls under the player's and the High Priest's control, with towns becoming corrupt, but offering unique resources.
     - NPCs may fear or respect the player, affecting future interactions and quest opportunities.
     - The player's appearance and abilities change, gaining dark powers at the cost of some NPC trust.

2. **Destroy the High Priest:**
   - *Solution:* The player fights and defeats the High Priest, attempting to end the plague by force.
   - *Consequences:*
     - The immediate plague threat is lifted, and villages begin to recover, praising the player as a hero.
     - However, the power vacuum left by the Priest's death leads to a struggle among other dark forces, creating new challenges and quests in Shadowfen.
     - Some NPCs, especially those who benefited from the chaos, may hold grudges against the player.

3. **Purify the High Priest:**
   - *Solution:* The player discovers a way to purify the High Priest's soul, breaking his connection to the rot and ending the plague without bloodshed.
   - *Consequences:*
     - Shadowfen is freed from the plague, and the High Priest, now a remorseful ally, aids the player in future endeavors with his knowledge of the dark arts.
     - This peaceful resolution earns the player's respect and trust from the villagers, opening unique diplomatic paths in future quests.
     - However, purifying the Priest reveals a greater dark entity manipulating him, setting the stage for a larger conflict in the realm.
