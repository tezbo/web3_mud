### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The central hub at [B] ensures players naturally discover the main features of the Slums. The market connects to both social and hidden areas, encouraging diverse player interactions.
  
- **Exploration vs. Convenience:** The layout offers a mix of direct routes and branching paths, allowing for both quick navigation and deeper exploration. The hidden shack and sewer entrance reward players who stray from the beaten path.

- **Storytelling:** The Slums' design reflects a sense of disorder and poverty, with crowded spaces and ramshackle buildings. The placement of the Beggars' Square and Abandoned Shack offers narrative opportunities about the district's socio-economic challenges.

- **Realism:** The close clustering of market, tavern, and residential areas makes physical sense for a slum district, with logical transitions between spaces reflecting the community's daily life.

- **Vertical Space and Hidden Paths:** The Shadowfen Sewers introduce a vertical element, providing depth and potential connections to broader game areas, encouraging players to delve into darker, less visible parts of the district.
