**Design Notes:**

- **Flow and Central Hub:** The Marketplace serves as the central hub, naturally guiding players to essential services like the Blacksmith and Tavern. It is designed to be the first point of contact for players entering the district.
  
- **Exploration and Discovery:** The Hidden Alley provides a sense of mystery and exploration, encouraging players to venture beyond the obvious paths. This hidden path adds depth and rewards curiosity.

- **Logical Organization:** Shops are logically grouped by purpose (crafts and services), and the Tavern is centrally located for social interaction, reflecting a realistic market layout.

- **Pacing:** Essential services are clustered around the Marketplace for easy access, while optional areas like the Hidden Alley are placed farther away, maintaining a balance between convenience and exploration.

- **Vertical Space:** While this area is primarily horizontal, potential vertical expansions could include upper floors in the Tavern for guest rooms or a hidden underground chamber accessed through the Hidden Alley.
