#### Room List with Exits:

1. **Market Square**  
   - Exits: North to Blacksmith, East to Tailor, South to Alleyway to Docks
   - Notes: Central hub of the Merchant District. Bustling with stalls and vendors. Acts as the main intersection for players to access the other shops.

2. **Blacksmith**  
   - Exits: South to Market Square, North to Apothecary
   - Notes: Specializes in weapons and armor. The forge's heat can be felt even from the Market Square. Logical proximity to the Apothecary for potions that enhance crafting.

3. **Apothecary**  
   - Exits: South to Blacksmith
   - Notes: Filled with shelves of herbs and potions. Located north to symbolize "healing" or "higher" direction. Close to Blacksmith for crafting synergies.

4. **Tailor**  
   - Exits: West to Market Square, East to General Store
   - Notes: Offers clothing and light armor. Positioned between Blacksmith and General Store for natural player flow.

5. **General Store**  
   - Exits: West to Tailor
   - Notes: Sells general goods and adventuring supplies. Located at the district's edge to suggest a transition point for players moving in or out of the district.

6. **Alleyway to Docks**  
   - Exits: North to Market Square
   - Notes: Narrow and somewhat hidden exit leading to the docks district. Encourages exploration and discovery. Provides a sense of realism for goods arriving by water.

#### Design Notes:

- **Flow:** Players enter the Market Square and can easily access specialized shops. The layout encourages looped exploration, especially with the Apothecary's placement requiring players to pass through the Blacksmith.
- **Discovery:** The Alleyway to Docks serves as a hidden path that rewards curious players with an alternate district exit.
- **Pacing:** The district is compact yet varied, with logical clustering of related services around the Market Square, ensuring players feel a sense of progression as they explore.
- **Realism:** The layout mimics real-world markets with a central hub and surrounding commerce. The proximity of Blacksmith and Apothecary supports crafting narratives.
- **Vertical Space:** Not utilized in this district as the focus is on open-air commerce and street-level exploration, fitting the Shadowfen style where ground-level interaction is key.
