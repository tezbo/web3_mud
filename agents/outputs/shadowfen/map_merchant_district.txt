- **Purpose**: Each room has a distinct role. The Marketplace is the heart of trade, the Apothecary and Blacksmith provide goods and services, the Pawnshop offers mystery and intrigue, and the Tavern serves as a social and quest-giving hub. The Hidden Alley adds an element of discovery and secrecy.

- **Exploration and Discovery**: The Hidden Alley rewards players who venture off the beaten path, offering hidden quests and secretive interactions.

- **Realism**: The layout makes sense with shops and services surrounding the central Marketplace, while the more clandestine activities are tucked away in the Hidden Alley.

This design balances accessibility with mystery, encouraging players to immerse themselves in the vibrant yet shadowy world of the Merchant District.
