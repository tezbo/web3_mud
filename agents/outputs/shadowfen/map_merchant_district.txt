### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The Market Square serves as the central hub, ensuring that players can navigate to any major shop easily. The flow encourages players to return to the Market Square after visiting other locations.
  
- **Purpose:** Each shop serves a distinct purpose, catering to different player needs. The layout encourages exploration of each shop based on player interests.

- **Discovery:** While the main shops are directly accessible from the Market Square, the Tailor is slightly hidden, rewarding those who explore the Apothecary's quieter path.

- **Realism:** The district layout mimics a realistic small trade area where essential services are centralized, and specialized services are slightly off the main path.

- **Storytelling:** The Watchtower provides a narrative element of security and oversight, while the Curio Shop adds mystery and intrigue, enhancing the district's lore.
