4. **Apothecary**

### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Central Hub (Market Square):** Serves as the district's focal point, with easy access to all major locations, encouraging player interaction and commerce.
- **Flow:** The district's layout naturally guides players through the main commercial areas, with the Market Square as the central node.
- **Discovery:** The Hidden Alley offers an element of mystery, rewarding players who explore beyond the main paths.
- **Pacing:** The clustering of shops around the Market Square provides a sense of a bustling commercial hub, while the Tailor and Hidden Alley offer a quieter, more secluded experience.
- **Realism:** The placement of shops around a central square mirrors real-world market districts, enhancing immersion.
- **Vertical Space:** This district is primarily horizontal, focusing on ease of navigation in a compact commercial area. Future expansions could introduce layered complexity with multi-level buildings.
