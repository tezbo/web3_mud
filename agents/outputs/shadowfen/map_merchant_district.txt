#### Room List with Exits:

1. **Market Square**
   - Exits: North to Blacksmith, East to Apothecary, South to Silk Road
   - Purpose: Central hub for the Merchant District. Bustling with traders and shoppers, this is where players can gather information and purchase general goods.

2. **Blacksmith**
   - Exits: South to Market Square
   - Purpose: Provides weapons and armor. Logical placement next to Market Square for easy access by adventurers seeking upgrades before heading out on quests.

3. **Apothecary**
   - Exits: West to Market Square
   - Purpose: Offers potions and herbal remedies. Positioned for convenient access for those in need of healing supplies or concoctions.

4. **Silk Road**
   - Exits: North to Market Square, South to Warehouse, East to Jeweler
   - Purpose: A narrow, winding street lined with various stalls selling exotic textiles and trinkets. Acts as a connector between key areas while offering exploration opportunities.

5. **Jeweler**
   - Exits: West to Silk Road
   - Purpose: Specializes in rare gems and jewelry. Positioned slightly off the main path to create a sense of discovery, encouraging players to venture beyond the primary routes.

6. **Warehouse**
   - Exits: North to Silk Road
   - Purpose: Storage for goods coming in and out of the district. Potential side quest location involving supply chain disruptions or hidden treasure.

#### Design Notes:

- **Flow and Centralization:** The Market Square serves as the hub, with all initial paths leading from it, ensuring players naturally encounter the primary services.
- **Exploration and Discovery:** The Jeweler is placed off the main Silk Road, rewarding players who take the time to explore beyond the obvious paths.
- **Realism and Cohesion:** The arrangement logically groups similar services together (e.g., Blacksmith and Apothecary near the central hub for quick access; Warehouse at the district's edge).
- **Pacing:** Important rooms (Market Square, Blacksmith, Apothecary) are immediately accessible, while the exploration of Silk Road and the discovery of the Jeweler add depth.
- **Shadowfen Style:** Reflects the district's dark, swampy aesthetic with twisting paths and tightly packed structures, creating an atmosphere of mystery and intrigue.
