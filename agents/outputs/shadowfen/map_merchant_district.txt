### Design Notes

- **Flow**: The Market Square is the central hub, ensuring all players naturally pass through this area when navigating the district. This design encourages social interaction and trading.
- **Exploration**: Although the main areas are easily accessible, there are incentives to explore the less obvious connections, such as the path through the Tavern to the Tailor.
- **Realism**: The placement of the Blacksmith near the Warehouse makes sense for material supply logistics. The Alchemist's proximity to the Market Square allows for easy access to exotic goods.
- **Pacing**: The Market Square's central location balances the district, providing a consistent point for players to branch out and explore the other specialized shops and facilities.
- **Storytelling**: Each room contributes to the narrative of a thriving trading hub, where each shop has a role in the overall economy. The Blacksmith and Warehouse highlight the industrial aspect, while the Market Square and Alchemist emphasize commerce and mystery.
