### Design Notes:

- **Flow and Central Hub:** The Market Square acts as a central hub, connecting to most key locations, ensuring players naturally encounter important shops and services.
  
- **Exploration and Discovery:** The Alley North provides a more subtle entry into the district, hinting at possible hidden interactions or events.

- **Pacing and Realism:** The district is logically organized with the Market Square at the center, shops nearby, and the Trade Guild Hall slightly removed but still easily accessible.

- **Vertical Complexity:** While no vertical levels are explicitly designed, the potential for hidden basements or rooftops accessible via the Alley could be considered for expansion.

This layout ensures a balanced mix of exploration, convenience, and storytelling through spatial design, consistent with Shadowfen's immersive atmosphere.
