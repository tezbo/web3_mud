### Design Notes

- **Central Hub**: The Market Square serves as the central hub, providing easy access to all other locations. This layout encourages players to pass through the square frequently, maintaining its lively atmosphere.
  
- **Flow**: Players naturally progress from the Market Square to other locations based on their needs (e.g., gear upgrades at the Tailor or Armorer, potions at the Apothecary).

- **Discovery**: While the main paths are direct, the interconnected nature of the Tavern and Bakery offers a sense of exploration within the district, encouraging players to visit both for different needs.

- **Pacing**: The layout purposely clusters related shops around the square for convenience, while the Tavern and Bakery are slightly removed to encourage exploration and interaction.

- **Realism**: The arrangement makes sense for a medieval-style merchant district. Essential services like the Armorer and Apothecary are easily accessible, while leisurely visits like the Tavern and Bakery are nearby but require more exploration.

- **Shadowfen Style**: The design incorporates a sense of mystery and medieval charm, with the Apothecary and Tavern particularly embodying the murky, atmospheric qualities of the Shadowfen style.

This "Merchant District" design balances exploration, convenience, and thematic storytelling.
