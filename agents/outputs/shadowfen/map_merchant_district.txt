Certainly! Below is the ASCII map for the 'Merchant District' in Shadowfen style, along with a room list, exits, and design notes.

**Room List with Exits:**

1. **Central Market Square**
   - Exits: North to Apothecary, East to General Goods, South to Hidden Alley
   - Notes: This is the central hub of the district. It's a bustling area with market stalls and traders. Players are naturally drawn here as it connects to all other rooms.

2. **Apothecary**
   - Exits: South to Central Market Square
   - Notes: A place for players to purchase potions and herbs. Its position north of the square implies a slightly quieter, more secluded atmosphere suitable for alchemy.

3. **General Goods**
   - Exits: West to Central Market Square, South to Tailor
   - Notes: Offers a wide variety of items necessary for adventuring. Located conveniently next to the square for easy access, and next to the Tailor for logical consumer flow.

4. **Blacksmith**
   - Exits: North to Central Market Square
   - Notes: Players can buy and repair weapons and armor here. Positioned to be easily accessible yet slightly off the main path to suggest the heavy work done here.

5. **Tailor**
   - Exits: North to General Goods, West to Hidden Alley
   - Notes: Sells clothing and light armor. Positioned to be near General Goods to imply a shared clientele. The exit to Hidden Alley suggests secretive dealings or a less reputable side business.

6. **Hidden Alley**
   - Exits: North to Central Market Square, East to Tailor
   - Notes: A secretive and narrow passage that rewards players who explore. Could hold hidden vendors or quests. Provides a sense of discovery, linking back to the square for ease of navigation.

**Design Notes:**

- **Flow:** The district is designed to encourage exploration from the central hub. The Central Market Square acts as the main point of interest, with pathways leading to specialized shops.
- **Discovery:** The Hidden Alley adds a layer of mystery and rewards players who stray from the main path. It also creates a shortcut between the Tailor and the central hub.
- **Pacing:** Shops are clustered around the market square to maintain logical consumer flow while allowing players to explore the district without feeling overwhelmed.
- **Realism:** The layout makes physical sense with the main commercial activities centered around the market, and specialized services branching out logically.
- **Vertical Space:** Not used in this small district, keeping the focus on horizontal exploration.

This design captures the bustling yet slightly mysterious atmosphere of a 'Shadowfen' Merchant District, encouraging both commerce and exploration.
