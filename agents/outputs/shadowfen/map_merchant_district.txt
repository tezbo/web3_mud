### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The Market Square acts as the central hub, ensuring players naturally converge here. It directly connects to the key commercial rooms, encouraging exploration from the central point outward.
  
- **Exploration:** The Hidden Path offers a reward for players who explore the less obvious routes. Additionally, the vertical integration of the Alchemist's and Armory rooms adds depth and complexity.
  
- **Purpose and Connections:** Each room is logically placed to reflect its purpose within the district. The Apothecary and Alchemist's are linked, suggesting a layered professional relationship. Similarly, the Blacksmith's and Armory are connected to emphasize production and storage. The General Store's proximity to the Hidden Path adds intrigue and potential narrative hooks.

- **Stylistic Elements:** The Shadowfen style, known for its mysterious and somewhat foreboding atmosphere, is reflected in the ambient details and secretive passages, inviting deeper exploration and engagement with the environment.
