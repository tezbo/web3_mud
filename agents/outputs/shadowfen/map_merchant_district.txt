### Room List with Exits

1. **Central Square**
   - Exits: North to Shadow Market, South to Misty Alley, East to Guild Hall
   - Purpose: Acts as the central hub for the Merchant District. A bustling area where traders gather, and rumors circulate. Often the starting point for adventures in the district.

2. **Shadow Market**
   - Exits: South to Central Square, West to Alchemist's Den
   - Purpose: The heart of commerce, filled with stalls and shops selling rare and exotic goods. A place for barter and negotiation.

3. **Alchemist's Den**
   - Exits: East to Shadow Market
   - Purpose: A mysterious shop filled with potions and arcane ingredients. Serves as a specialty vendor for players seeking enhancements or unique items.

4. **Guild Hall**
   - Exits: West to Central Square, South to Smuggler's Passage

   - Purpose: An underground route used by smugglers. Offers shortcuts to other parts of Shadowfen and holds hidden treasures and dangers. Appeals to players seeking adventure and risk.

### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Flow:** Central Square is designed as the main hub to facilitate easy navigation to other key locations. Players can naturally discover the Shadow Market and Guild Hall from here, encouraging interaction with merchants and quest givers.
  
- **Discovery:** Misty Alley and Smuggler's Passage are intentionally less direct routes, rewarding players who take the time to explore with unique experiences and potential rewards.

- **Pacing:** The layout allows players to engage in quick trading at the Shadow Market or delve deeper into narrative and quests at the Guild Hall. The hidden nature of Misty Alley and Smuggler's Passage adds layers of complexity.

- **Realism:** The district layout mirrors a plausible urban design with commerce areas centrally located and specialized or clandestine venues slightly off the main paths.

- **Vertical Space:** Not used here, but Smuggler's Passage hints at an underground network, suggesting further vertical exploration opportunities in extended maps.

This design balances exploration with convenience, making the Merchant District a dynamic and engaging area within Shadowfen.
