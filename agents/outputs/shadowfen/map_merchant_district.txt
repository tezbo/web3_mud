Certainly! Here's a design for the "Merchant District" in Shadowfen style:

```
          [Alchemy Shop]
               |
               N
               |
               S
  [Tailor]--W--[Market Square]--E--[Blacksmith]
               |
               S
               |
          [General Goods]
               |
               S
               |
          [Hidden Alley]

```

**Room List with Exits:**

1. **Market Square**
   - Exits: North (N) to Alchemy Shop, West (W) to Tailor, East (E) to Blacksmith, South (S) to General Goods
   - Notes: This is the central hub of the Merchant District. It's a bustling area with vendors and is the primary location for trade and interaction. It connects to all other rooms, making it a logical gathering point.

2. **Alchemy Shop**
   - Exits: South (S) to Market Square
   - Notes: A specialized shop located just north of the Market Square, offering potions and unique ingredients. Its slightly secluded position adds an aura of mystique, drawing adventurers seeking rare concoctions.

3. **Tailor**
   - Exits: East (E) to Market Square
   - Notes: This shop offers clothing and armor, situated to the west of the square. Its proximity to the Market Square ensures easy access for those needing quick repairs or new garments.

4. **Blacksmith**
   - Exits: West (W) to Market Square
   - Notes: Found to the east of the Market Square, this is where weapons and armor are crafted and repaired. Its location allows for easy access from the market, facilitating trade and custom orders.

5. **General Goods**
   - Exits: North (N) to Market Square, South (S) to Hidden Alley
   - Notes: Situated south of the Market Square, this shop provides a variety of essentials for adventurers. It's the stepping stone between the bustling market and the more secluded Hidden Alley.

6. **Hidden Alley**
   - Exits: North (N) to General Goods
   - Notes: A narrow, less-traveled path south of the General Goods store. It offers a sense of discovery with potential for secret meetings or black market goods. It's a reward for players who explore beyond the obvious paths.

**Design Notes:**

- **Flow:** The Market Square serves as the central hub, ensuring players naturally pass through it to access other locations, reinforcing its importance.
- **Discovery:** The Hidden Alley is an optional area that rewards exploration with potential secrets or hidden quests.
- **Pacing:** The layout clusters related shops around the central square, spreading out the less obvious locations like the Hidden Alley.
- **Realism:** The design logically places specialized shops around a central market, reflecting a realistic and functional merchant district.
- **Vertical Space:** Not applicable in this design, as it's a surface-level district focused on commerce.

This design balances exploration and convenience while creating a coherent and engaging environment for players in the Shadowfen style.
