### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Flow:** The Market Square acts as the central hub, encouraging players to pass through it frequently. The main shops (General Store, Blacksmith, Apothecary, and Tailor) are all accessible from this hub, ensuring that all players encounter the key locations.
  
- **Discovery:** The Hidden Alley adds a layer of intrigue, accessible only from the Blacksmith and Tailor. It rewards players who explore beyond the obvious paths, providing shortcuts and hidden opportunities.
  
- **Realism:** The Merchant District's layout reflects realistic urban planning, with the central market surrounded by specialized shops. The Hidden Alley is a believable feature, offering both a sense of mystery and practical routing.

- **Pacing:** The rooms are clustered with related shops close to each other, while the Hidden Alley introduces a more secluded, optional area for players seeking adventure or secrecy.

This layout balances exploration with convenience, ensuring that players can easily navigate the district while also encountering rewarding discoveries.
