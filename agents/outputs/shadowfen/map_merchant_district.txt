### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The Market Square serves as the central hub, facilitating easy access to all shops. It encourages players to pass through and explore the district naturally.
- **Discovery:** While the map is straightforward, the placement of the Jeweler Shop as a less direct path (via the Tailor) adds an element of discovery for players.
- **Pacing:** The distance and arrangement provide a sense of scale and immersion, with the East Gate offering a transition point to other districts.
- **Realism:** The layout ensures shops with related themes (e.g., Tailor and Jeweler) are close, while essential services like the Blacksmith are accessible from the Market Square. The East Gate provides a logical boundary for the district.
