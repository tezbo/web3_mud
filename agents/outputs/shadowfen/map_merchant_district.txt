### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Central Hub (Market Square):** Acts as the navigational heart, from where players can choose directions based on their objectives (shopping, quests, or exploration). This ensures players naturally pass through it, increasing engagement.
- **Flow and Exploration:** The district's design encourages exploration, with the Bazaar's maze-like paths and Artisan's Row's hidden workshops. Players are rewarded with rare items and unique interactions.
- **Pacing and Realism:** The progression from a busy market to quieter residential and warehouse areas provides a realistic urban experience. The layout reflects a logical flow of goods from storage ([W]) to market ([M]).
- **Vertical Space:** Not used in this district to maintain a horizontal spread typical of outdoor merchant areas, focusing on lateral exploration and discovery.
