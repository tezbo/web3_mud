### Design Notes

- **Flow and Exploration**: The Market Square serves as a central hub with access to all other locations, encouraging players to start their exploration here.
- **Convenience vs. Discovery**: While most essential services are easily accessible from the Market Square, the Bazaar is slightly off the main path to encourage discovery.
- **Logical Organization**: The Blacksmith is logically placed away from the Apothecary to avoid noise disturbing the delicate potion-making process. The General Store is centrally located for convenience.
- **Natural Storytelling**: The layout reflects a typical medieval merchant district, with the Market Square as the focal point of commerce and social interaction.
- **Pacing and Distance**: The design spreads out pivotal locations, like the Tavern and Apothecary, to encourage movement through the district and engagement with multiple spaces before reaching destinations.
