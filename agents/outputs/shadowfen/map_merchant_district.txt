### Design Notes

- **Flow**: The Market Square serves as the central hub, with most locations easily reachable from it. This ensures players can quickly navigate to key shops.
  
- **Discovery**: The Warehouse is slightly off the main path, rewarding players who explore beyond immediate shops.

- **Pacing**: Shops are clustered around the Market Square, with the Warehouse providing a sense of distance and purpose for exploration.
  
- **Realism**: Logical placement of shops around a central square mimics real-world market layouts, with supply lines (Warehouse to Blacksmith) enhancing believability.

- **Vertical Space**: Not used in this layout to maintain simplicity and accessibility for a small district.
