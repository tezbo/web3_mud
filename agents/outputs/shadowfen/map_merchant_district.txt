### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose**: The design starts at the Market Square, encouraging players to explore northward or eastward naturally. Shop locations are strategically placed to ensure a logical flow, with essential services like potions and armor closer to the central hub.
  
- **Exploration vs. Convenience**: The district offers a balance, with shops easily accessible from the central Market Square for convenience, while still encouraging exploration through the network of interconnected shops.

- **Storytelling Through Space**: The arrangement of shops around the Market Square tells a story of a thriving merchant community, with specialized shops branching off from the main hub. Each shop's thematic design helps reinforce the Shadowfen atmosphere.

- **Realism**: The layout makes physical sense, as shops are logically connected and positioned in relation to one another, mirroring the flow of a realistic merchant district.

- **Layered Complexity**: While this map is surface-level, hidden elements or vendor-specific quests could be integrated to add depth, such as secret deals or exclusive items found through interactions within the district.
