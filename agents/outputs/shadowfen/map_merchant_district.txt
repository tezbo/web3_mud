**Design Notes on Flow and Purpose:**

- **Central Hub:** Market Square ([A]) acts as the district's core, facilitating easy movement to other areas and maintaining high foot traffic.
  
- **Flow:** Players naturally navigate from the central market to specialized areas like Artisan Alley ([B]) and Blacksmith's Forge ([D]). The General Goods Store ([C]) is easily accessible for quick shopping trips.

- **Discovery:** The Secretive Backroom ([F]) serves as a hidden space for players who explore beyond the obvious paths, adding an element of mystery and reward.

- **Pacing:** The district is compact but layered, with the main thoroughfares leading to essential services and quieter alleys leading to residential and secretive zones.

- **Realism:** The layout reflects a realistic arrangement of a merchant district, with workshops near the central market and residential spaces slightly removed for privacy.

This design emphasizes the contrast between the lively market environment and the quieter, more secretive undertones of Shadowfen, encouraging exploration and providing a sense of depth.
