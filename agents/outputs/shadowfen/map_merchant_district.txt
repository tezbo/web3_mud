### Design Notes

- **Flow and Exploration**: The Market Square acts as a central hub, allowing players to easily navigate to various shops. The Hidden Alley adds an element of discovery for those willing to explore beyond the obvious paths.
  
- **Balance of Convenience and Exploration**: Essential services like the Blacksmith and Alchemy Shop are accessible yet spaced to require traversing the district. This layout encourages players to pass through the Market Square, enhancing the sense of community and activity.

- **Storytelling and Realism**: The district reflects a logical arrangement where complementary shops are near each other (e.g., Tailor and Jewelers), while the Hidden Alley introduces an element of mystery characteristic of Shadowfen.

- **Vertical Space Consideration**: Though not explicitly vertical, the map includes a hidden dimension with the Hidden Alley, suggesting subterfuge and intrigue without the need for physical elevation changes.
