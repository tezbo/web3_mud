```

**Room List with Exits:**

1. **Marketplace**
   - Exits: North to Apothecary, East to General Store, South to Tavern
   - Purpose: The central hub of the Merchant District where traders gather. It serves as the primary area for commerce and social interaction.

2. **Apothecary**

3. **General Store**
   - Exits: West to Marketplace, South to Blacksmith

4. **Blacksmith**
   - Exits: North to General Store

5. **Tavern**

6. **Alleyway**

**Design Notes:**

- **Flow**: The Marketplace acts as the central hub, ensuring that players can easily navigate to various shops from a single point. The radial design promotes a sense of exploration while maintaining convenience.
  
- **Discovery**: The Alleyway offers a hidden route, enticing players who enjoy uncovering secret areas. It could potentially connect to future expansions or hidden content.

- **Realism**: The layout reflects a logical setup for a merchant district, with shops clustered around a central market. The Apothecary's position suggests a separation from the more bustling areas, providing a quieter space for its delicate wares.

- **Pacing**: While the Marketplace is the busiest area, the Apothecary and Blacksmith offer specialized interactions. This setup allows players to pace their shopping and exploration.

- **Vertical Space**: Although this design is primarily horizontal, future expansions could introduce vertical elements like a watchtower or underground smuggling tunnels accessible from the Alleyway.

This layout balances exploration and convenience while maintaining a realistic and engaging environment for players in the Shadowfen style.
