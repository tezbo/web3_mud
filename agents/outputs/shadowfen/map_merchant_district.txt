### Design Notes

- **Flow**: The Marketplace acts as a central hub, allowing players to naturally flow between specialized shops. The Auction House's strategic placement north of the Marketplace draws players into the district.
- **Discovery**: By situating the Alchemist slightly to the west, it encourages exploration beyond the central path. The arrangement avoids linear movement, promoting a dynamic exploration experience.
- **Pacing**: Shops are clustered around the Marketplace, ensuring related services are conveniently accessible while retaining a sense of distance and exploration.
- **Realism**: The layout reflects a believable town structure, where common trade areas are central, and specialized services are slightly off the main path. This mirrors the logical organization of a bustling merchant district.

By integrating these design principles, the Merchant District offers a balanced mix of convenience and exploration, encouraging players to engage with both the central hub and peripheral areas within the district.
