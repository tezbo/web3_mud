### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The Market Square serves as the central hub, ensuring all paths lead to this key area. The design encourages players to explore each specialized shop while maintaining a logical flow of goods from docks to market.
  
- **Discovery:** While the main paths are straightforward, players might discover NPCs with unique quests or rare items in less-trafficked areas, like the Warehouse.

- **Pacing:** The district is compact, intentionally clustering related rooms together while maintaining distinct roles for each to encourage exploration without overwhelming the player.

- **Realism:** The spatial organization reflects a realistic medieval trade district, with the flow of goods naturally moving from docks to storage to market.

- **Vertical Space:** While not utilized in this layout, future expansions could introduce layered complexity, such as a second floor in the Tailor for custom fittings or a cellar in the Apothecary for brewing potions.
