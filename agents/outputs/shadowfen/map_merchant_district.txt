### Design Notes:

- **Flow and Purpose:** The Market Square acts as a central node, allowing easy access to all other rooms and ensuring that players naturally encounter the main areas of commerce.
- **Discovery:** The Tavern Cellar offers a hint of mystery and exploration, potentially leading to hidden quests or interactions with shady characters.
- **Pacing:** The clustering of the Alchemist and Clothier around the Market Square encourages players to explore each shop in sequence while maintaining a sense of progression.
- **Realism:** Shops are logically organized around the central hub, reflecting a realistic layout where traders and shoppers can easily navigate between stores.
- **Vertical Space:** The Blacksmith is accessible via stairs from the General Store, adding a vertical element that suggests a multi-level environment, typical for a more industrial area like a forge. 

This design offers a balance of exploration, logical layout, and thematic cohesion within the Shadowfen style.
