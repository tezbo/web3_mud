### Design Notes:

- **Flow and Purpose**: The Market Square serves as the district's central hub, enabling straightforward navigation to key commercial areas while promoting a sense of community. The Apothecary and Blacksmith are logically positioned for easy access to travelers and locals alike.

- **Exploration and Discovery**: The Hidden Path offers a secretive route back to the Tailor Shop, rewarding players who explore beyond the main paths. This path adds an element of discovery and surprise.

- **Pacing and Realism**: The district features a sensible layout with clustered commercial spaces around the central Market Square. The docks provide a tangible sense of distance and realism, representing the district's connection to trade routes.

- **Vertical Space and Layered Complexity**: Although primarily a street-level district, the potential for vertical expansion exists through hidden basements or lofts in future expansions, maintaining the Shadowfen's mysterious allure.
