**Design Notes:**

<<<<<<< HEAD
- **Flow**: The Town Square acts as the central hub, providing a natural starting point. Market Street connects the key commercial locations, ensuring players move through the heart of the district.
- **Exploration**: The Alleyway serves as a hidden path, rewarding those who venture off the beaten path. It can be used for side quests or to uncover secrets about the district.
- **Pacing**: The main pathway (Town Square → Market Street → Armorer → Docks) offers a logical progression, while the Potion Shop and Alleyway provide optional detours.
- **Realism**: The layout reflects a typical trading district with a central gathering spot, main commercial street, and specialized shops. The Docks provide a realistic endpoint connecting to other regions.
- **Vertical Space**: While this district is primarily horizontal, the potential for vertical exploration exists within shops (e.g., Potion Shop with a basement for rare ingredients). 

This design encourages exploration, balances the central hub with peripheral areas, and maintains a sense of realism and mystery fitting for Shadowfen.
=======
- **Flow:** The Market Square acts as the central hub, guiding players naturally to various shops, ensuring they encounter key locations without excessive backtracking.
- **Discovery:** The Fishmonger's shop offers a hidden connection to the Blacksmith, encouraging players to explore beyond initial expectations.
- **Vertical Space:** Not emphasized in this district due to the swampy terrain, focusing instead on horizontal exploration.
- **Realism:** Each shop's placement reflects a logical arrangement based on trade needs and environmental factors (e.g., Blacksmith near water for practicality).
- **Shadowfen Style:** The district's layout and themed shops reflect a sense of mystery and natural integration typical of Shadowfen, enhancing the atmospheric storytelling.
