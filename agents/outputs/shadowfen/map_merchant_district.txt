### Design Notes

- **Flow and Exploration**: The Market Square ensures all locations are easily accessible, with the Hidden Alley providing an exciting discovery element and shortcut.
- **Purpose and Realism**: Shops are logically arranged around the central hub, with related trades (like the Blacksmith and Tailor) being closer to each other. The Shady Tavern's placement is intentionally on the district's fringe, reflecting its unsavory nature.
- **Narrative and Interaction**: The district's layout facilitates storytelling, with the central hub acting as a focal point for adventures and quests, while hidden paths and side rooms encourage exploration and reward persistent players.
