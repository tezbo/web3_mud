#### Design Notes:

- **Flow and Purpose**: The Market Square serves as the central hub, ensuring that players naturally pass through it to reach other locations. The positioning of shops around the square encourages exploration, with each shop serving a specific adventuring need.
  
- **Exploration and Discovery**: The Street Alley offers a less-traveled path to the Weapon Smith, rewarding players who explore beyond the main thoroughfares. This layout also hints at the existence of potential hidden or side paths leading to other districts or special locations.

- **Realism and Storytelling**: The clustering of related shops (e.g., Armor Smith and Potion Shop) reflects logical commercial zoning, enhancing realism. The layout tells a story of a thriving merchant community designed to cater to adventurers and townsfolk alike.

- **Pacing and Balance**: Shops are clustered around the Market Square for convenience, while the Street Alley and Weapon Smith are placed to create a sense of distance and journey, adding depth to the district's exploration.
