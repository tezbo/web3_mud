### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Flow**: The layout encourages players to start at the Market Square, a natural gathering point, and explore outward. Each shop is just a short walk from this hub, facilitating easy navigation.
- **Purpose**: The arrangement reflects the practical needs of adventurers and residents, with essential services clustered around the Market Square. Shops are grouped logically; for instance, the Armory and Tailor are close, catering to those interested in personal gear.
- **Exploration and Realism**: The design balances exploration with convenience. Players can quickly find what they need but are also encouraged to explore each shop for unique items. The placement of the Tavern near the Market Square ensures it is a social focal point.
- **Vertical Space**: While this district remains on a single level for simplicity, future expansions could include multi-level buildings for added complexity, such as a cellar in the Tavern or an upstairs potion lab in the Apothecary.
