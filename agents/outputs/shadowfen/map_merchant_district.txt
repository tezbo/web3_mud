### Room List with Exits

1. **Market Square**
   - Exits: North to Workshop, East to Apothecary, South to Armorer, Southwest to Hidden Path
   - Purpose: Central hub of the district with various stalls and vendors. It serves as the key navigation point for players exploring the Merchant District. Natural storytelling occurs through overheard conversations and bustling activity.

2. **Workshop**
   - Exits: South to Market Square
   - Purpose: A place where players can craft or repair items. The Workshop is a logical northern addition as it is slightly removed from the main commercial activity, providing a quieter space for focused tasks.

3. **Apothecary**
   - Exits: West to Market Square
   - Purpose: A shop offering potions and remedies. Positioned to the east for easy access from the Market Square, encouraging players to visit for healing supplies after combat.

4. **Armorer**
   - Exits: North to Market Square, East to Hidden Path, South to Tailor
   - Purpose: A shop specializing in weapons and armor. Its location provides a direct route back to the Market Square and a connection to the hidden path, hinting at discreet dealings or special services.

5. **Tailor**
   - Exits: North to Armorer
   - Purpose: A shop for clothing and light armor, found on the southern edge of the district. This placement encourages players to explore deeper into the district for specialty items.

6. **Hidden Path**
   - Exits: Northwest to Market Square, West to Armorer
   - Purpose: A secretive, less-traveled route connecting the Armorer to the Market Square. This path offers a shortcut and potential for hidden encounters or quests, rewarding players who explore.

### Design Notes

- **Flow and Exploration**: The Market Square serves as the central hub, ensuring players encounter it frequently. The district's design encourages exploration with the strategically placed hidden path and logical shop arrangements.
- **Convenience vs. Exploration**: While the Market Square provides convenient access to most shops, the Tailor's position further away requires intentional exploration, balancing convenience with discovery.
- **Natural Storytelling**: Each room offers unique interactions and narrative elements, from the bustling Market Square to the quiet Workshop. The Hidden Path provides opportunities for secrets and side quests.
- **Realism**: The layout makes physical sense with logical clustering of related services (e.g., Armorer near Hidden Path for discreet transactions).
- **Layered Complexity**: The use of the Hidden Path and varied shop placements introduces complexity without overwhelming new players.
