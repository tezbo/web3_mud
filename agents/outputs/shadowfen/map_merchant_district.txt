**Design Notes:**

- **Flow:** The Market Square [M] serves as the central hub, with most shops connected to it, ensuring high foot traffic and easy navigation for players.
- **Discovery:** Players may discover hidden discounts or unique items by visiting less apparent shops like the Tailor's Shop [T] and Blacksmith [B].
- **Pacing:** The layout encourages players to pass through the Market Square multiple times, promoting interaction and trade.
- **Realism:** The arrangement reflects realistic town planning, with the docks [D] at the edge for trade, and the stables [S] nearby for travelers.
- **Merchant Dynamics:** The proximity of shops to the Market Square creates a lively commerce atmosphere, while the docks' connection to the stables facilitates the flow of goods and travel.
- **Shadowfen Style:** The district adopts a slightly swampy, fog-laden atmosphere with wooden planks and lanterns guiding the paths, reflecting the Shadowfen style of murky, mysterious trade routes.
