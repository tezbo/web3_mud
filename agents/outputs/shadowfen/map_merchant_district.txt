### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose**: The Market Square serves as the primary hub, with shops clustered around it for easy access. The placement of the Bank, General Store, and Clothier creates a logical flow for players to navigate through the district.
  
- **Exploration and Discovery**: The Hidden Alley is designed to reward players who explore beyond the obvious paths, offering unique items or quests unavailable elsewhere.

- **Realism and Storytelling**: The layout reflects a typical medieval market town, where essential services are centralized, and specialty shops are within walking distance, promoting a vibrant economic center.

- **Vertical Space and Complexity**: While this district is primarily on a single plane, the Hidden Alley introduces an element of layered complexity. Future expansion could consider vertical elements like an upstairs room in the Bank or a cellar in the General Store.

This design balances accessibility with the intrigue of discovery, utilizing logical spatial organization to create a believable and engaging district.
