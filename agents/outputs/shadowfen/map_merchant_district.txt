### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The Market Square serves as the primary hub with multiple exits, ensuring players naturally explore all areas. The Blacksmith and Tailor Shop are placed logically near the Market Square to draw players interested in gear and attire.

- **Exploration & Discovery:** The Alley provides a shortcut and an opportunity for players to discover hidden quests or NPCs. This adds depth and rewards those who stray from the main path.

- **Pacing & Clustering:** Shops are clustered around the Market Square to simulate a bustling merchant environment. The Inn is slightly offset to provide a sense of progression from the central hub.

- **Realism:** The Tannery is placed further from the market to realistically separate its smell from the bustling center. This reflects a realistic town layout where more unpleasant industries are located on the outskirts.

- **Vertical Space:** Not utilized in this design, maintaining a focus on horizontal exploration typical of an outdoor district. Future expansions could include basements for some shops or a rooftop garden for the Inn.
