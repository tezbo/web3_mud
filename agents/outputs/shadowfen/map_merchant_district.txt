Sure, I'll design a 'Merchant District' in the Shadowfen style, which is likely to include elements like dark, twisted alleyways, an air of mystery, and a touch of the supernatural.

```
    [Blacksmith] -- [Potion Shop] -- [Dark Alley]
         |              |                |
    [Market Square] -- [Curio Shop] -- [Secret Passage]
         |
    [Tavern]
```

**Room List with Exits:**

1. **Market Square**
   - **Exits:** North to Blacksmith, East to Curio Shop, South to Tavern
   - **Notes:** Central hub of the district; bustling with various merchant stalls. This is the main gathering spot, connecting most other rooms. The square is often lively with traders and shadowy figures.

2. **Blacksmith**
   - **Exits:** South to Market Square, East to Potion Shop
   - **Notes:** The clang of metal echoes here. The blacksmith provides essential equipment for adventurers and is strategically placed near the market for easy access to raw materials.

3. **Potion Shop**
   - **Exits:** West to Blacksmith, East to Dark Alley
   - **Notes:** This shop is filled with strange odors and bubbling concoctions, providing potions and alchemical supplies. Its location near the blacksmith suggests a synergy between crafting and enchantment.

4. **Dark Alley**
   - **Exits:** West to Potion Shop, South to Secret Passage
   - **Notes:** A narrow, shadowy path that seems to absorb the light. This alley is where deals are made in the shadows and secrets are whispered. Its exit to the secret passage rewards those who explore.

5. **Curio Shop**
   - **Exits:** West to Market Square, East to Secret Passage
   - **Notes:** A mysterious shop filled with oddities and rare artifacts. Its placement suggests it's a place for adventurers to find unique items or information, bridging the bustling market and the hidden passage.

6. **Tavern**
   - **Exits:** North to Market Square
   - **Notes:** The district's social center for relaxation and gossip. Positioned just south of the market, it's a convenient spot for travelers to unwind after a day of trading or exploring.

**Design Notes:**

- **Flow and Purpose:** The Market Square acts as the district's heart, ensuring a natural flow of traffic. Shops are positioned logically around the square, offering a variety of services (equipment, potions, curiosities). The tavern provides a social and resting point directly accessible from the square.
- **Discovery and Exploration:** The Dark Alley and Secret Passage introduce elements of mystery and secrecy, enticing players to explore beyond the obvious paths. The secret passage, in particular, suggests hidden connections or shortcuts within the district.
- **Shadowfen Style:** The district's design incorporates an atmosphere of intrigue and subtle danger, fitting the Shadowfen vibe. The dark alleyways and secretive shops enhance the mysterious aesthetic.
