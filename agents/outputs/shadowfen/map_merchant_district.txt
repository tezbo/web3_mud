### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Central Hub (Market):** The Market serves as the heart of the Merchant District, ensuring high traffic and easy access to all other locations. This design encourages gathering and trading, essential for a vibrant district.
- **Flow:** The district encourages a natural flow from specialized shops to the central hub and back, promoting exploration without overwhelming players with excessive paths.
- **Discovery:** While the district is compact, the outer shops like the Apothecary and General Store reward players who explore all the exits from the Market.
- **Pacing:** The district is designed to be navigated quickly due to its small size, but with enough complexity to prevent it from feeling linear or simplistic.

This layout provides a balanced mix of accessibility and exploration, with a central hub that ties the district together while rewarding players who venture to every corner.
