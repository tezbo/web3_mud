#### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The Market Square acts as the central hub, naturally guiding players to explore the Tailor's Shop and Trader's Alley. From there, players can discover more specialized locations like the Blacksmith's Forge and the Hidden Alley.
  
- **Discovery:** The Hidden Alley encourages exploration and rewards players with unique narrative opportunities or secret dealings.

- **Pacing:** The progression from the busy Market Square to the quieter, more secluded areas like the Hidden Alley and Storage Warehouse provides a balance between social interaction and solitary exploration.

- **Realism:** The layout reflects a realistic merchant district, with shops logically placed around a central market. The Storage Warehouse is conveniently located near Trader's Alley for easy access.

- **Vertical Space:** Although this design is primarily horizontal, consider adding a second story to the Tailor's Shop for living quarters or a basement in the Blacksmith's Forge for material storage in future expansions.
