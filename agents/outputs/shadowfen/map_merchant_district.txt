### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose:

- **Central Hub:** The Market Square serves as the central hub, ensuring players can easily navigate to the primary shops.
- **Logical Layout:** Shops that logically benefit from proximity are placed adjacent to each other (e.g., Blacksmith next to Armory).
- **Flow:** The layout encourages players to pass through the Market Square, reinforcing its role as a central location.
- **Discovery:** Players exploring beyond the Market Square will find specialized shops rewarding their exploration.
- **Pacing:** Related services (e.g., Blacksmith and Armory) are clustered, while more distant services (e.g., Apothecary and Tailor) provide a sense of distance and exploration.
- **Realism and Storytelling:** The layout reflects a realistic merchant district, with the Market Square as the heart of commerce, surrounded by specialized trade shops, each with its own character and offerings.
