### Design Notes:

- **Flow and Central Hub:** The Marketplace acts as the central hub, naturally guiding players through the district's various shops. The layout promotes exploration, with multiple interconnected paths ensuring no single linear route.
  
- **Discovery and Exploration:** While the main commercial area is straightforward, the Residential Alley suggests potential for hidden paths or quests, rewarding players who venture beyond the typical merchant interactions.

- **Realism and Immersion:** Each shop's position reflects its role; the Blacksmith is strategically placed to draw players into the market, while the Apothecary and Tailor provide logical transitions to residential life.

- **Pacing and Balance:** The map balances convenience with exploration. It clusters related rooms (shops) for easy access while the Residential Alley adds depth and potential for narrative expansion.
