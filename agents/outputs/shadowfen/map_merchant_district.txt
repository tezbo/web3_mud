   - **Purpose:** A small guard post overseeing the district, providing security and a vantage point. Offers a potential quest-giver or lookout scenario for players.

3. **Apothecary**
   - **Exits:** West to Market Square
   - **Purpose:** A dimly lit shop filled with strange herbs and concoctions. Offers healing potions and unique Shadowfen remedies. Encourages exploration due to its mysterious inventory.

4. **Fishmonger's**

6. **Blacksmith**

**Design Notes:**

- **Flow:** The Market Square acts as the central hub, guiding players naturally to various shops, ensuring they encounter key locations without excessive backtracking.
- **Discovery:** The Fishmonger's shop offers a hidden connection to the Blacksmith, encouraging players to explore beyond initial expectations.
- **Vertical Space:** Not emphasized in this district due to the swampy terrain, focusing instead on horizontal exploration.
- **Realism:** Each shop's placement reflects a logical arrangement based on trade needs and environmental factors (e.g., Blacksmith near water for practicality).
- **Shadowfen Style:** The district's layout and themed shops reflect a sense of mystery and natural integration typical of Shadowfen, enhancing the atmospheric storytelling.
