- **Flow:** The district encourages a natural flow from specialized shops to the central hub and back, promoting exploration without overwhelming players with excessive paths.

- **Pacing:** The district is designed to be navigated quickly due to its small size, but with enough complexity to prevent it from feeling linear or simplistic.

This layout provides a balanced mix of accessibility and exploration, with a central hub that ties the district together while rewarding players who venture to every corner.
