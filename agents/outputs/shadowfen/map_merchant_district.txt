### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Flow and Convenience**: The Market Square [1] serves as the main hub with multiple exits, allowing easy access to other rooms. The layout encourages exploration while maintaining a logical flow, as shoppers drift from the bustling square to specific stores.
  
- **Exploration and Discovery**: While the core path is clear, the layout entices players to explore with the strategic placement of the Exotic Imports [6] in a less obvious location, rewarding those who venture further.
  
- **Realism and Storytelling**: The arrangement reflects a realistic merchant district, with essential shops like the General Goods Store [2] and Blacksmith's Forge [4] placed near the central hub. Specialty shops such as the Fine Apparel Boutique [3] and Exotic Imports [6] are positioned to attract specific audiences.

- **Layered Complexity**: Although a small district, the intertwined paths and slightly offset locations create a sense of depth and richness, encouraging players to interact with each room for a fuller experience.

This design balances the need for a logical, navigable layout with the allure of exploration and discovery, characteristic of Shadowfen's atmospheric and immersive setting.
