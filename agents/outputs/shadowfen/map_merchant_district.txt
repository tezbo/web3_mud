   - Purpose: A lively establishment where traders and adventurers gather. The tavern offers rest and rumors, serving as a social hub. Players can overhear hints about the Hidden Path here.

3. **General Store**

### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The Market Square acts as the central hub, allowing easy navigation to surrounding shops. Players naturally encounter each shop while exploring the district.
  
- **Discovery:** The Hidden Path offers an element of mystery. Players who pay attention to conversations in the Tavern or clues in the Apothecary may find this path.

- **Pacing:** Shops and services are clustered around the Market Square for convenience, with the Hidden Path offering an element of intrigue for those who explore more thoroughly.

- **Realism:** The layout makes physical sense, with the central square serving as a natural gathering place, surrounded by businesses that benefit from high foot traffic.

- **Vertical Space:** While this district focuses on horizontal exploration, vertical elements could include upper floors in the Tavern or a cellar in the Apothecary for future expansions.
