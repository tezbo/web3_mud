### Room List and Exits

1. **Market Square**
   - Exits: North to Apothecary, East to Blacksmith
   - Purpose: Central hub of the district, bustling with merchants and customers. Serves as the main gathering point and starting location for exploration.

2. **Apothecary**
   - Exits: South to Market Square, East to Tailor
   - Purpose: Offers potions and herbal remedies. A quieter, more mysterious location with shelves of strange ingredients. Connection to Tailor emphasizes the district's interconnected trade network.

3. **Blacksmith**
   - Exits: West to Market Square
   - Purpose: Provides weapons and armor. The heat and clamor contrast with the calmer Market Square. Its position allows easy access for adventurers returning from quests.

4. **Tailor**
   - Exits: West to Apothecary, East to Jeweler
   - Purpose: Sells clothing and fabrics. Positioned between the Apothecary and Jeweler to illustrate the progression from practical needs to luxury items.

   - Purpose: Specializes in fine jewelry and rare gems. Represents the pinnacle of luxury in the district, with a sense of exclusivity due to its location at the edge.

### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The Market Square serves as a natural hub where players can start their exploration. The linear path from Apothecary to Jeweler encourages a progression from practical to luxury goods, while still allowing for easy navigation back to the central hub.
  
- **Exploration vs. Convenience:** The district is compact but offers a logical path through its various shops. The Apothecary’s connection to both the Market Square and Tailor encourages exploration beyond just the main square.

- **Realism:** The layout makes physical sense, with shops that logically cluster together based on related trades. This mirrors real-world marketplaces where related businesses often group for convenience.

- **Storytelling Through Space:** Each shop tells its own story through its position and connections. The Apothecary’s secluded position suggests a place of subtlety and mystery, while the Jeweler’s edge location implies exclusivity.

This design balances the need for a compact district with the desire for exploration and story, creating a vibrant, interconnected merchant area that feels both alive and logical.
