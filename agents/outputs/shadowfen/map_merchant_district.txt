### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose**: The Market Square serves as the central hub, ensuring players naturally discover all shops through exploration. Each shop's position around the square encourages players to explore each direction.
  
- **Discovery and Exploration**: The interconnected paths between the Blacksmith and Alchemist's Shop create a loop, offering multiple routes and encouraging exploration.

- **Realism and Storytelling**: The Tailor is isolated to the north, implying a quieter, more specialized trade, while the Bakery is to the east, hinting at the daily bread run. The Stables' southeastern position suggests a connection to travel and adventure.

- **Vertical and Layered Complexity**: Although this map is on a single level, the conceptual design allows for vertical complexity, such as a basement in the Alchemist's Shop or a loft in the Tailor for further expansion.

This design balances convenience with exploration, providing a logical and immersive shopping experience in the Merchant District.
