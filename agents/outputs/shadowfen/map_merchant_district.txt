Design Notes:
- Flow: The Market Square [3] is the central hub, allowing easy access to all major locations. It is naturally the busiest area, reflecting the district's focus on trade.
- Exploration: The Observation Tower [2] provides vertical interest and an optional vantage point, rewarding those who seek it out with information or perhaps a quest.
- Discovery: Artisan Alley [4] is slightly off the main path, encouraging players to explore its unique offerings.
- Pacing: Players start at the Entrance Gate [1], get drawn into the Market Square [3], and then have multiple paths to explore, balancing discovery with convenience.
- Realism: The layout logically places high-traffic areas at the heart, with specialized functions like the Trade Consortium [5] located deeper within for a sense of progression.
- Vertical Space: The inclusion of an Observation Tower [2] adds a layer of complexity and realism, fitting the Shadowfen style by providing strategic oversight of the district.
