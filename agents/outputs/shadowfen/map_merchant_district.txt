**Design Notes:**

- **Flow:** The Market Square [A] acts as the central hub with multiple exits to ensure high player traffic and ease of navigation. Players naturally move from the central area to the Blacksmith's Forge [B] and then further to the Apothecary [C], promoting exploration.
  
- **Discovery:** Room [F], the Hidden Smuggler's Den, is a reward for players who explore beyond the obvious exits. This hidden path offers a sense of discovery and adventure.

- **Pacing:** The layout encourages players to move through the district in a circular fashion, starting from the Market Square and looping back after exploring the northern and southern peripheries.

- **Realism:** The district layout reflects practical urban design, with a central hub and specialized shops surrounding it, while residential areas are slightly removed to maintain a sense of living quarters away from the bustling market.

This design balances exploration, convenience, and storytelling, making the Merchant District both functional and engaging for players.
