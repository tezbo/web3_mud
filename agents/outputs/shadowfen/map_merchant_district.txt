Certainly! Let's design the "Merchant District" in the Shadowfen style, focusing on a blend of commerce, mystery, and organic layouts.

### Room List with Exits:

1. **[M] Market Square**
   - **Exits:** North to [B], East to [A], South to [G], West to [D]
   - **Purpose:** The bustling central hub of the district, filled with stalls, vendors, and the heart of trade in Shadowfen. It serves as the primary navigational anchor.

2. **[B] Bazaar of Shadows**
   - **Exits:** South to [M]
   - **Purpose:** A mysterious, dimly lit area where rare and exotic goods are traded. Offers occasional quests and hidden paths to those who explore its secrets.

3. **[A] Alchemist's Alley**
   - **Exits:** West to [M], Southeast to [T]
   - **Purpose:** A narrow street lined with shops selling potions, herbs, and magical trinkets. Provides access to unique items and serves as a secondary commercial area.

4. **[D] Dockside Warehouse**
   - **Exits:** East to [M], South to [S]
   - **Purpose:** A storage and shipment hub for goods coming in and out of Shadowfen. Contains hidden passages leading to smuggler's tunnels.

5. **[S] Smuggler's Cove**
   - **Exits:** North to [D]
   - **Purpose:** A secretive hideout used by less savory merchants. Offers hidden quests and a shortcut to the undercity.

6. **[G] Guild Hall**
   - **Exits:** North to [M]
   - **Purpose:** Headquarters for the Merchant Guild. A place to gather information, acquire trade permits, and engage in guild-related activities.

### Design Notes:

- **Flow:** The Market Square [M] acts as the central hub with multiple exits, allowing players to naturally transition between different commercial and narrative areas.
  
- **Discovery:** Alchemist's Alley [A] and Bazaar of Shadows [B] encourage exploration with their unique offerings and hidden paths. The Smuggler's Cove [S] adds a layer of mystery and reward for those who seek it.

- **Pacing:** The district is designed to have a mix of high-energy areas like the Market Square and quieter, more intrigue-focused areas like the Dockside Warehouse.

- **Realism:** The layout mimics a real-life commercial district with logical placement of warehouses by the docks and specialized shops clustered together.

- **Vertical Space:** Potential vertical elements could include upper floors in shops for private dealings or basements in the Dockside Warehouse for storage and secretive activities.

This map offers a blend of commerce, exploration, and intrigue fitting the Shadowfen style, inviting players to delve deep into the district's secrets.
