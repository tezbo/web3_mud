### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose:

- **Flow**: The Market Square serves as a central hub, allowing players to easily navigate to different areas based on their needs. The layout encourages movement through the square for both convenience and storytelling.
- **Discovery**: The Alley provides an element of mystery and exploration, rewarding players who stray from the beaten path with potential secrets.
- **Realism**: The arrangement of rooms mirrors a realistic town layout, with the Market Square as the focal point and related businesses logically positioned around it.
- **Pacing**: By clustering key locations around the Market Square and placing the Guild Hall slightly further, exploration feels both rewarding and appropriately paced.
- **Vertical Space**: The design is primarily horizontal to reflect the open, bustling nature of a market district, with vertical elements implied in future expansions (e.g., multi-story shops or hidden cellars).
