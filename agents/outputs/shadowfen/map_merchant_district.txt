### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose**: The Market Square acts as the primary hub, with direct connections to essential shops (General Store and Tailor Shop) to maintain a logical shopping flow. The Blacksmith is connected to the General Store to encourage players to prepare for adventures.
- **Exploration and Discovery**: The layout encourages players to explore beyond the main square. The Residential Alley and Storage Yard provide a sense of discovery and potential for hidden quests or secrets.
- **Realism**: The district layout follows a logical progression from a busy commercial center to quieter residential areas, with appropriate transitions between shops and living spaces.
- **Pacing**: The rooms are clustered to create a sense of community while spreading out to give a realistic sense of distance, especially towards the Residential Alley and Storage Yard.

This design ensures a balanced mix of accessibility, exploration, and storytelling within the Merchant District, capturing the unique Shadowfen atmosphere.
