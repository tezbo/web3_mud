**Design Notes:**

- **Flow:** The Market Square acts as the central hub, allowing players to discover important locations naturally. Exits are positioned to create a logical flow between commerce, social, and residential spaces.
  
- **Discovery:** The Clocktower offers potential hidden paths (e.g., a rooftop or cellar) for players inclined to explore vertically. The Residential Alley could have hidden entrances to underground networks or special homes.

- **Pacing:** By clustering shops around the Market Square and placing the Residential Alley further out, the design maintains a balance between accessibility and exploration.

- **Realism:** Shops are logically placed around the market for easy access, while the tavern's connection to the residential area reflects its role as a communal hub.

- **Vertical Space:** The Clocktower serves as a vertical element, providing both narrative importance and a physical feature for players to interact with.
