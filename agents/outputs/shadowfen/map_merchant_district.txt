### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The Market Square serves as the central hub, allowing players to easily navigate to key locations. The cluster of shops around the square promotes natural exploration and interaction.
  
- **Discovery:** The Hidden Alley is an optional area that rewards players who explore the less obvious paths, adding a layer of mystery and intrigue.

- **Pacing:** The arrangement encourages players to visit multiple shops in sequence, with the Alchemist’s Workshop acting as a transition to more secretive areas.

- **Realism:** The layout reflects a logical organization typical of a bustling district, with essential services like the blacksmith and general store directly accessible from the main square.

- **Vertical Space:** While this layout is primarily horizontal, the inclusion of a Hidden Alley suggests verticality in terms of storytelling, as it hints at deeper, possibly subterranean spaces yet to be discovered.
