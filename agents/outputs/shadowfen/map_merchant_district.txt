Certainly! Here's a design for the 'Merchant District' in a Shadowfen style, which might reflect a somewhat dark, swampy, and mysterious atmosphere.

### Room List with Exits

1. **Town Square**
   - **Exits**: South to Market Street
   - **Notes**: Central hub of the district; a bustling area where merchants set up stalls. Players naturally gather here, making it the starting point for exploration.

2. **Market Street**
   - **Exits**: North to Town Square, East to Potion Shop, South to Armorer
   - **Notes**: Main thoroughfare lined with various small merchant stalls. Connects important locations and encourages exploration.

3. **Potion Shop**
   - **Exits**: West to Market Street
   - **Notes**: A small, dimly-lit shop filled with bubbling cauldrons and rare ingredients. Offers unique potions and serves as a quest point for alchemists.

4. **Armorer**
   - **Exits**: North to Market Street, East to Alleyway, South to Docks
   - **Notes**: A sturdy structure where players can upgrade gear. Positioned to be easily accessible from the main path while leading to more hidden areas.

5. **Alleyway**
   - **Exits**: West to Armorer
   - **Notes**: A narrow, shadowy path that might hide secrets or shortcuts. Offers a hidden path and potential for storytelling through discovered mysteries.

6. **Docks**
   - **Exits**: North to Armorer
   - **Notes**: The end of the district near the water's edge. Serves as a transition point to other areas or quests involving the nearby swamps or waterways.

### Design Notes

- **Flow**: The Town Square acts as the central hub, providing a natural starting point. Market Street connects the key commercial locations, ensuring players move through the heart of the district.
- **Exploration**: The Alleyway serves as a hidden path, rewarding those who venture off the beaten path. It can be used for side quests or to uncover secrets about the district.
- **Pacing**: The main pathway (Town Square → Market Street → Armorer → Docks) offers a logical progression, while the Potion Shop and Alleyway provide optional detours.
- **Realism**: The layout reflects a typical trading district with a central gathering spot, main commercial street, and specialized shops. The Docks provide a realistic endpoint connecting to other regions.
- **Vertical Space**: While this district is primarily horizontal, the potential for vertical exploration exists within shops (e.g., Potion Shop with a basement for rare ingredients). 

This design encourages exploration, balances the central hub with peripheral areas, and maintains a sense of realism and mystery fitting for Shadowfen.
