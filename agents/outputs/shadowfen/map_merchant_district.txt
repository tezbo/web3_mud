Below is the design for the 'Merchant District' in Shadowfen style. The district is characterized by its bustling trade, shadowy alleys, and a slightly eerie atmosphere, all set within a swampy region. This district serves as the main commercial hub where players can trade, gather information, and encounter intrigue.

### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Central Hub:** The Market Square serves as the primary gathering point with easy access to specialized shops and a clear path to hidden areas.
- **Flow and Exploration:** Players are encouraged to explore the Alchemist's Lair for unique items and then discover the Hidden Alleyway, which provides shortcuts and narrative intrigue.
- **Convenient Layout:** Essential services (Armory, Trader's Haven) are clustered around the Market Square, ensuring that players can easily access crucial locations.
- **Realism and Storytelling:** The district’s layout reflects a logical organization of commerce, secrecy, and swampy ambiance, perfectly matching the Shadowfen style.
- **Vertical Complexity:** While primarily horizontal, the inclusion of secret paths adds depth and rewards exploration.

This design balances the need for a lively, engaging commercial area with opportunities for secretive exploration and narrative development.
