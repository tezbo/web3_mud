- **Discovery:** The Warehouse hints at possible hidden paths or quests related to trade and smuggling, rewarding players who explore beyond the main roads.
- **Pacing:** Shops are clustered around the Market Square for convenience, while the Warehouse is slightly removed, adding a sense of distance and intrigue.
