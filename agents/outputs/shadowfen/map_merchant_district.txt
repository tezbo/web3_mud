### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose**: The Market Square [1] acts as the central hub, ensuring players can easily access any part of the district. By clustering related shops along [3] and [5], players can efficiently navigate through trade-related activities.
  
- **Discovery and Exploration**: The Mystic's Corner [4] is slightly off the beaten path, encouraging exploration and rewarding players with unique finds. Its placement is intentional to provide a sense of mystery and reward for thorough exploration.

- **Pacing and Realism**: The district's layout is designed to mimic a realistic market area, with a central square, specialized alleys, and a tavern for social interaction. The Herbalist's Grove [2] adds a touch of nature, balancing the urban feel.

- **Logical Organization**: The placement of shops and tavern follows a logical flow, avoiding jarring transitions like placing a blacksmith next to a temple. The armory and mystic shops are placed where players naturally seek them, enhancing immersion.

This design ensures a balance of convenience and exploration, with logical room connections and a natural flow through the Merchant District.
