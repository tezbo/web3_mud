### Design Notes

- **Flow and Exploration**: The Marketplace serves as the central hub, naturally leading players to explore the essential services like the Blacksmith and Bank. The Alchemist’s Shop is slightly off the main path to encourage discovery.

- **Convenience vs. Exploration**: Key services (Bank, Blacksmith) are close to the Marketplace for convenience, while more specialized services (Alchemist, Docks) require additional exploration.

- **Storytelling Through Space**: The placement of the Docks at the district's edge suggests potential for further adventures and trade with distant lands, enhancing the narrative of commerce and travel in Shadowfen.

- **Realism and Logical Organization**: The district layout reflects a logical organization of services, with related trades (Blacksmith and Tailor) positioned near each other, while the Marketplace acts as the commercial heart.

- **Layered Complexity**: Vertical space is not used here, focusing instead on horizontal exploration with potential for future underground or above-ground expansions (e.g., a cellar in the Alchemist's Shop or an upstairs office in the Bank).
