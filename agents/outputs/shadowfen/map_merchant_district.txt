**Design Notes:**

- **Flow:** The Market Square serves as the central hub, allowing easy access to the surrounding shops. The square’s design encourages players to naturally discover key locations as they explore.
  
- **Exploration vs. Convenience:** The district is compact, with shops clustered around the Market Square for convenience. However, the Warehouse and Dock provide a sense of exploration for those venturing outside the main paths.

- **Storytelling:** The placement of the Smithy and Tailor reflects the craftsmanship valued in Shadowfen, while the Apothecary's proximity to the Market Square suggests the importance of trade in herbal goods.

- **Realism:** The layout reflects a logical organization, with the Market Square as the central hub and specialized shops branching out. Each room is placed to reflect its role in the district’s economy.

- **Vertical Space:** Not used in this district design, as the focus is on horizontal flow and ease of navigation for merchants and customers. Vertical elements can be introduced in a larger city map with multi-story buildings or underground pathways.
