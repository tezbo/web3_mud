#### Design Notes

- **Flow and Exploration**: The Market Square acts as the central hub, allowing players to quickly orient themselves and choose their next destination. Each specialized shop is easily accessible, emphasizing trade and commerce as the district's primary theme.
  
- **Discovery**: The Apothecary's positioning encourages players to explore beyond the obvious paths, rewarding them with unique potions and lore about Shadowfen's herbal practices.

- **Pacing and Realism**: Shops requiring heavy and raw materials (Blacksmith, Tannery) are placed on the outskirts to minimize disruption to the central square. The Jeweler's strategic location opposite the Blacksmith highlights the cultural blend of utility and luxury within the district.

- **Vertical Space Consideration**: While this design focuses on a horizontal layout, vertical spaces could be incorporated within individual shops, such as cellars in the General Store for storage or a loft in the Tannery for curing hides.

This layout ensures a balance between convenience and exploration, fostering a sense of community while encouraging players to delve deeper into the district's unique offerings.
