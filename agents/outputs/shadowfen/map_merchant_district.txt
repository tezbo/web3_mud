### Design Notes

- **Flow**: The Marketplace serves as a central hub, ensuring players naturally encounter it upon entering through the North Gate. From here, the district's layout encourages exploration of surrounding shops.
- **Discovery**: Each room serves a distinct purpose, with the potential for hidden interactions or quests, particularly in the Potion Shop or Tailor.
- **Pacing**: Shops are clustered around the Marketplace to maintain a sense of community and trade activity, while still providing enough space between each for a natural flow.
- **Realism**: The layout reflects a logical organization where shops offering related services (Armory and Smithy) are positioned near each other, enhancing both realism and convenience.
- **Vertical Space**: While this design does not include vertical elements, the potential for vertical expansion exists in the form of multi-story shops or hidden basements for future development.
