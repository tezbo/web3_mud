### Room List with Exits

1. **Central Market Square**
   - Exits: North (Herbalist Shop), East (Shadowy Alley), West (Alchemist Lab), South (Fishmonger's Stall)

2. **Herbalist Shop**
   - Exits: South (Central Market Square)
   - Notes: A quaint shop filled with the aromas of rare herbs and potions. It serves as a gateway to the northern part of the district, offering players various alchemical supplies.

3. **Alchemist Lab**
   - Exits: East (Central Market Square)

4. **Fishmonger's Stall**
   - Exits: North (Central Market Square)

5. **Shadowy Alley**
   - Exits: West (Central Market Square), East (Secret Warehouse)
   - Notes: A narrow, dimly-lit path that connects to the less savory parts of the district. The alley is a favorite spot for shady deals and offers a sense of hidden danger.

6. **Secret Warehouse**
   - Exits: West (Shadowy Alley)
   - Notes: A concealed location accessible only through the Shadowy Alley. It contains rare and possibly illicit goods, rewarding those who explore the darker corners of the district.

### Design Notes

- **Flow and Exploration:** The Central Market Square serves as the main hub, ensuring players naturally find the exits to other rooms. Each room offers something different, encouraging players to explore each area for unique interactions or items.
  
- **Discovery and Hidden Paths:** The Shadowy Alley and Secret Warehouse provide elements of mystery and reward exploration. The secretive nature of these areas offers special goods or quests not found elsewhere.
  
- **Pacing and Realism:** Shops related to each other in function are clustered together, with the Herbalist Shop and Alchemist Lab both focusing on potion-making. The Fishmonger's Stall provides a different atmosphere, enhancing the district's diversity.
  
- **Vertical and Layered Complexity:** While the district is primarily on one level, the inclusion of a hidden warehouse adds a layer of depth, suggesting the presence of more beneath the surface.

This layout balances a sense of bustling trade with Shadowfen's murkier aspects, encouraging players to delve into both commerce and intrigue.
