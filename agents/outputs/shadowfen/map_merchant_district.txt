Design Notes:
- Flow: The map is designed to naturally guide players through the central hub [A], encouraging exploration of the surrounding rooms.
- Clustering: Shops are clustered around the market [A], while storage areas like [E] are positioned further from residential and market zones.
- Discovery: Players may find hidden transactions and rare goods by exploring less trafficked areas like [E] and [F].
- Realism: The market square serves as a logical central hub, with nearby artisan and guild activities. Residential and storage areas extend further out, maintaining a sense of logical urban planning.
- Vertical space: While not explicitly depicted, interiors like the Merchant Guild Hall [C] could have additional floors for offices or meeting rooms.
