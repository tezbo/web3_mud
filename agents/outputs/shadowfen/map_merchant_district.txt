**Design Notes on Flow and Purpose:**

- **Central Hub:** The Market Square acts as a central hub, allowing easy access to all major shops, promoting a fluid movement of players.
- **Flow:** Each shop is logically positioned based on thematic relevance (e.g., Blacksmith and Armorsmith are close). The Market Square provides a clear and direct way to navigate the district.
- **Exploration and Discovery:** The Warehouse is an optional area, serving as a reward for players who explore beyond the main shops. It can contain hidden quests or rare items.
- **Realism and Storytelling:** The district layout reflects a realistic medieval marketplace where trade is the heart of activity. The proximity of related shops suggests a well-organized trade district.
- **Vertical Complexity:** Not applicable here as the design focuses on a horizontal layout, but verticality could be added in future expansions with a lookout tower or underground vaults.
