### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Central Hub (Market Square):** Functions as the main gathering spot, ensuring players encounter each other and share experiences. It creates a natural starting point for exploration within the district.
- **Flow:** The district is structured to lead players from the central Market Square outward, with natural connections between shops that thematically complement each other.
- **Discovery:** The Hidden Alley adds an element of mystery and reward for players who delve deeper into the district, encouraging exploration beyond the obvious.
- **Pacing and Realism:** The layout balances convenience and exploration. Shops are logically placed, with armory and tailor close for ease of gear acquisition, while the tavern and general store serve as resource points.
- **Layered Complexity:** Encourages vertical thinking with hidden elements and the potential for quests or discoveries in less-traveled areas.

This design ensures that while the Merchant District is compact, it offers both necessary resources and incentives for exploration, enriching player experience in a Shadowfen-themed environment.
