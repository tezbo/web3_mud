Here's a design for the 'Merchant District' in the Shadowfen style:

```
[Market Square] -- [Apothecary] -- [Tailor's Shop]
     |                  |
[General Store]      [Hidden Alley]
     |
[Dockside Tavern]

```

**Room List and Exits:**

1. **Market Square**
   - Exits: North to Apothecary, South to General Store
   - Design Notes: Central hub of the Merchant District, bustling with stalls and vendors. Serves as the primary social and commercial gathering spot. Players naturally start here to explore the district.

2. **Apothecary**
   - Exits: South to Market Square, East to Tailor's Shop
   - Design Notes: A small, dimly lit shop with shelves of potions and herbs. Positioned close to the Market Square for easy access to suppliers and customers. The connection to the Tailor's Shop encourages players to explore further east.

3. **Tailor's Shop**
   - Exits: West to Apothecary
   - Design Notes: Filled with colorful fabrics and mannequins. Positioned at the edge of the district, drawing players to the northern area. Provides crafting materials and serves as a quieter spot away from the central hustle.

4. **General Store**
   - Exits: North to Market Square, South to Dockside Tavern
   - Design Notes: Stocks a variety of goods necessary for adventurers. Acts as a transition from the commercial area to the more relaxed environment of the tavern. Its placement ensures high foot traffic from players moving south.

5. **Dockside Tavern**
   - Exits: North to General Store
   - Design Notes: A cozy, dimly lit establishment frequented by traders and dock workers. Located at the southern edge, it serves as a resting place and a point of interest for players exploring beyond the district.

6. **Hidden Alley**
   - Exits: West to Apothecary
   - Design Notes: A secretive path known only to a few, it provides a shortcut between the Apothecary and other areas outside the map. Rewards exploration with potential hidden quests and rare items. Adds depth and mystery to the district.

**Design Notes:**

- **Flow and Purpose:** The map encourages exploration with the central Market Square as the starting point. Players naturally flow from the bustling square to more specialized shops. The layout balances easy navigation with hidden surprises.
- **Discovery and Pacing:** The Hidden Alley offers a sense of discovery and rewards players who take the time to explore beyond the obvious paths. The positioning of the Tavern and Tailor's Shop creates a sense of distance and diversity in the district's layout.
- **Realism:** The arrangement of shops and social spaces reflects a realistic urban setting where related businesses are clustered, and social venues are a short walk from commercial areas.
