### Design Notes:

- **Flow:** The Clocktower Plaza acts as the central hub, naturally leading to the specialized shops. The paths from the plaza to the shops are straightforward, allowing players to easily find what they need.
  
- **Discovery:** The Shadow Market is slightly hidden, encouraging exploration and rewarding players with unique items or information.

- **Pacing:** The district is designed to encourage players to linger and explore. The Herbalist's and Alchemist's shops are linked, creating a small loop for players interested in magical goods.

- **Realism:** The layout resembles a typical medieval market district with a central plaza and surrounding shops, fitting the Shadowfen theme.
  
- **Vertical Space:** While this map doesn't use vertical spaces, the layered complexity is achieved through the interconnectedness of the shops and hidden alleyways.
