**Design Notes:**

- **Flow:** The Market Square serves as a central hub, with all paths leading from here. This design encourages players to naturally discover essential services as they move through the district.
  
- **Discovery:** The presence of a warehouse suggests potential hidden paths or shortcuts for players to explore, rewarding curiosity with quicker access to other districts or hidden items.

- **Pacing:** Shops are clustered around the Market Square, promoting easy access to essential services. The Warehouse, slightly out of the way, emphasizes its logistical nature.

- **Realism:** The layout reflects a realistic merchant area, with shops and services logically placed around a central market, as would be expected in a bustling trade district.

- **Vertical Space:** The map is primarily horizontal, with possible vertical exploration hinted at in the Warehouse, where goods might be stored on multiple levels.
