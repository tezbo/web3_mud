### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Flow**: The layout encourages players to pass through the Central Plaza frequently, allowing them to naturally discover all key locations. The main path from General Store to Blacksmith ensures essential services are easily accessible.
- **Discovery**: The Herbalist's Shop and Tailor's Shop are positioned as optional explorations off the main path, rewarding players who venture beyond the obvious route.
- **Realism**: This layout reflects a logical progression from the central hub of commerce (Central Plaza) outward to specialized services, with the Warehouse at the district's edge suggesting goods flow into the district.
- **Pacing**: By clustering the General Store and Blacksmith near the center, players can efficiently gather supplies. The Herbalist's Shop offers a break in the main path for focused, quieter exploration.
- **Storytelling**: The district's design narrates a bustling center of trade, with each shop contributing to the theme of commerce and community in Shadowfen style.
