### Room List and Exits:

1. **Plaza**
   - Exits: North to Alchemist, East to General Store, Southeast to Tailor, Southwest to Blacksmith
   - Purpose: Central hub for the Merchant District, a bustling area where players can gather, trade, and socialize. Acts as the primary navigation point.

2. **Alchemist**
   - Exits: South to Plaza
   - Purpose: Offers potions, herbs, and magical supplies. Located slightly away from the central Plaza to maintain the allure of mystery and delicate wares.

3. **General Store**
   - Exits: West to Plaza, South to Tailor
   - Purpose: Provides everyday necessities and adventuring gear. Positioned for easy access from the Plaza and Tailor, encouraging players to stop by frequently.

4. **Blacksmith**
   - Exits: North to Plaza, East to Warehouse
   - Purpose: Supplies weapons and armor, located near the Plaza to reflect its importance. Its proximity to the Warehouse facilitates the movement of heavy goods.

5. **Tailor**
   - Exits: North to General Store, Northwest to Plaza, South to Warehouse
   - Purpose: Offers clothing and fabric goods, conveniently placed between the Plaza and the Warehouse to symbolize the flow of textiles through the district.

6. **Warehouse**
   - Exits: North to Blacksmith, North to Tailor
   - Purpose: Storage for goods and materials, a quieter area where players might stumble upon hidden paths or side quests. Acts as a supplementary hub for the district's economy.

### Design Notes:

- **Flow:** The Plaza acts as the central hub, ensuring easy navigation while connecting to all primary shops directly. This setup promotes a natural flow from high-traffic areas to more specialized locations.
  
- **Exploration and Discovery:** The Warehouse, being slightly off the main path, offers opportunities for hidden paths and side quests, rewarding players who take the time to explore less obvious routes.

- **Pacing:** The layout creates a balanced experience, with clusters of related rooms (e.g., Blacksmith near Warehouse) and clear distance between them, reflecting a realistic sense of space.

- **Realism:** The organization reflects a logical town structure, with heavy industry (Blacksmith) close to storage (Warehouse) and specialized services (Alchemist) slightly detached for thematic reasons.

- **Vertical Space:** While this district is laid out on a single plane, the suggestion of hidden paths in the Warehouse could imply vertical exploration, such as a basement or secret loft area.
