### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose:

- **Central Hub:** The Market Square ([1]) acts as the central hub with multiple exits, ensuring high traffic and easy navigation to key locations.
- **Flow:** Starting at the Market Square, players are naturally directed to the General Store ([2]) and then further encouraged to explore the Apothecary ([3]) and Armor Shop ([4]).
- **Discovery:** The Hidden Tavern ([6]) is an optional area that rewards players who explore beyond the main paths, accessed through the Residential Alley ([5]).
- **Pacing:** Shops are clustered around the square, while the residential area provides a quieter space, spaced out from the bustling commercial areas.
- **Realism:** The layout logically places shops around a central market, with a residential alley leading to a hidden tavern, mimicking a realistic district layout.
