- **Discovery**: The Warehouse, slightly removed from the main hub, hints at hidden paths and secrets, encouraging players to delve deeper into the district.

- **Pacing**: Related services are clustered around the Market Square, while the Warehouse is further away, creating a sense of distance for bulk goods management.

- **Realism**: The layout reflects a logical organization typical of a merchant district, with the Market Square as the focal point and surrounding specialized shops.

- **Verticality**: While this map is primarily horizontal, the Warehouse offers potential for vertical exploration through hidden paths or upper storage levels.
