### Room List with Exits:

1. **Marketplace**
   - Exits: North to Blacksmith, East to General Store, South to Tavern
   - Notes: Central hub of the Merchant District. Bustling with vendors and traders. Acts as the main connection point for the district. Designed for high traffic and easy navigation to adjacent shops.

2. **Blacksmith**
   - Exits: South to Marketplace
   - Notes: Positioned north of the Marketplace to reduce noise pollution for other shops. Logical placement for easy access to crafted goods and repairs. Features a forge and display area.

3. **General Store**
   - Exits: West to Marketplace
   - Notes: A common stop for adventurers and locals alike. Stocks a wide variety of goods. Strategically placed to catch foot traffic coming from the Marketplace. Provides easy access to basic supplies.

4. **Tavern**
   - Exits: North to Marketplace, East to Alchemist
   - Notes: A social and resting hub, encouraging players to linger and interact. Positioned for easy access from the Marketplace, but away from the noisy Blacksmith. The connection to the Alchemist hints at potential storylines or quests.

5. **Alchemist**
   - Exits: West to Tavern, East to Warehouse
   - Notes: Offers potions and magical items, conveniently located near the Tavern for adventurers needing supplies. Transition point to the Warehouse, indicating a less-traveled route for those looking for hidden or special items.

6. **Warehouse**
   - Exits: West to Alchemist
   - Notes: Quiet, secluded location ideal for storage and secret dealings. Acts as a hidden area for quests or special items, rewarding those who explore beyond the main traffic areas.

### Design Notes:

- **Flow**: The Marketplace serves as the primary hub, ensuring players naturally pass through and discover important locations. The Blacksmith and General Store are easily accessible, while the Tavern encourages social interaction and quest-gathering.
  
- **Exploration**: The Alchemist and Warehouse create opportunities for discovery, with the latter providing a reward for players who explore beyond the obvious paths.

- **Realism**: The layout reflects a logical organization, with noisy and social areas placed thoughtfully in relation to each other. The Blacksmith is kept separate from the Tavern to maintain a pleasant atmosphere.

- **Pacing**: High-traffic areas are clustered around the Marketplace, with quieter, optional exploration paths leading to the Alchemist and Warehouse, balancing convenience and discovery.
