The narrow alleys of the Shadowfen slums are shrouded in a perpetual, clammy mist that clings to the skin like a damp shroud. The air is thick with the acrid stench of rotting vegetation and rust, mingling with the sour tang of unwashed bodies. Underfoot, the ground is a treacherous mix of mud and decaying leaves, squelching with each cautious step. Faint, discordant murmurs echo from shadowy doorways, where flickers of dim candlelight reveal gaunt faces etched with hard lines of survival.
