In the shadowy embrace of the slums, the air hangs thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint tang of rust. Narrow alleyways wind through a labyrinth of leaning shanties, their wooden slats softened by mildew and time. The distant drip of unseen water echoes softly, harmonizing with the hushed whispers of unseen watchers. Underfoot, the ground is slick with mud, every step a precarious dance on the slippery, uneven terrain. Lanterns flicker with a feeble glow, their light swallowed by the encroaching mist that clings to the skin like a cold, clammy shroud.
