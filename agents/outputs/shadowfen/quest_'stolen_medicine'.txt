**Title: The Cure's Cost**

**Stage Breakdown:**

1. **The Desperate Plea**  
   - In the murky village of Shadowfen, the herbalist Elara pleads for help. A shipment of rare medicinal herbs meant for treating the swamp fever outbreak has been stolen. Without the herbs, the villagers will suffer greatly.

2. **The Thieves' Trail**  
   - Through investigation, the player learns that a group of outcasts from the nearby village of Mirepoint, led by a charismatic rogue named Jarek, has taken the herbs. Each side claims desperation: Shadowfen needs the herbs to combat the fever, while Mirepoint's people are starving and see no other option for survival.

3. **The Crossroads of Choice**  
   - Confront Jarek and the outcasts in their makeshift camp in the swamps. The player must decide how to resolve the situation.

**Solutions and Consequences:**

1. **Negotiate a Compromise**  
   - **Solution:** The player mediates between Elara and Jarek, proposing that the herbs be split. Shadowfen can treat the most critical cases, and the outcasts receive a portion to trade for food.
   - **Consequences:** Relations between Shadowfen and Mirepoint improve, leading to future trade agreements. The player's reputation as a negotiator spreads, opening new diplomatic quests. However, some villagers remain resentful, feeling their plight was not fully prioritized.

2. **Side with Shadowfen**  
   - **Solution:** The player confronts Jarek and either convinces or forces him to return all the stolen herbs to Shadowfen, citing the immediate threat of the fever.
   - **Consequences:** Shadowfen is grateful and offers the player a unique herbal remedy as a reward. Mirepoint's outcasts grow more desperate and bitter, leading to increased tensions and occasional skirmishes along the swamp borders. The player might face hostile encounters with outcasts in future quests.

3. **Aid the Outcasts**  
   - **Solution:** The player chooses to support Jarek's plight, allowing the outcasts to keep the herbs and advising them on how to use them for trade or bartering.
   - **Consequences:** Mirepoint's outcasts gain new hope and begin to establish a more stable community, potentially becoming allies in future conflicts. Shadowfen, however, suffers a severe outbreak, leading to distrust of outsiders and increased suspicion towards strangers, including the player. Elara's health deteriorates, altering her presence in future quests.

**Lore Tie-in:**  
The conflict between Shadowfen and Mirepoint is rooted in the broader struggle for resources in the wake of The Sundering, a cataclysmic event that fractured the land and left many communities isolated and in need. The player's actions in this quest may influence how these communities adapt to the new world order and their stance on resource sharing and cooperation.
