**Quest Title: The Cure's Cost**

**Stage Breakdown:**

**Stage 1: The Missing Tonic**
- Hook: In the murky swamps of Shadowfen, healer Eldra approaches the player in distress. A shipment of rare medicine she desperately needs to treat a deadly swamp fever has gone missing. Without it, the afflicted will perish within days.
- Task: Investigate the missing shipment.

**Stage 2: The Traitor's Trail**
- The player discovers that the shipment was stolen by a local named Jorvik, who claims he needed it for his ailing daughter. However, rumors suggest he intends to sell it to a rival healer in the neighboring village for profit.

**Stage 3: The Decision**
- Present the player with three choices:
  1. **Confrontation**: Confront Jorvik and retrieve the medicine by force or persuasion. Return it to Eldra.
  2. **Negotiation**: Mediate a deal between Eldra and Jorvik, promising Eldra a portion of the future profits if she agrees to provide some medicine to Jorvik's daughter.
  3. **Subterfuge**: Secretly help Jorvik sell the medicine, but arrange for him to donate a portion of his earnings back to the village to fund future medicine supplies.

**Consequences:**

1. **Confrontation**:
   - *Positive*: Eldra is grateful and treats the sick, enhancing her reputation and offering the player discounted healing services in the future.
   - *Negative*: Jorvik is resentful, and tension in the community increases, leading to possible future conflicts that may involve the player.

2. **Negotiation**:
   - *Positive*: A new alliance forms between Eldra and Jorvik. The village benefits from a steady supply of medicine, and both parties vouch for the player, granting them influence in village decisions.
   - *Negative*: Future tensions arise if the deal is perceived as unfair by either side, potentially dragging the player into community disputes.

3. **Subterfuge**:
   - *Positive*: The player gains a cut of the profits and a reputation for cunning. Jorvik uses the money for his daughter and the village, gaining local support.
   - *Negative*: Eldra is suspicious of the player’s involvement and trust is damaged, leading to increased prices for her services and reluctance to help in future quests.

**World Impact:**
- The player's choices ripple through Shadowfen, affecting trade, community trust, and the player's standing among the villagers. Rumors of their actions spread, influencing how they are received in other territories and by different factions within the realm.
