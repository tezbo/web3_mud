**Quest Title: "The Healer's Dilemma"**

**Stage 1: Discovery**
- The player encounters Elara, a frantic herbalist in the swampy region of Shadowfen. She explains that a rare and potent batch of medicine, crucial for treating a deadly swamp fever outbreak, has been stolen from her workshop. Without it, the afflicted villagers will soon perish.

**Stage 2: Investigation**
- The player investigates and learns that the medicine was stolen by a desperate group of swamp-dwellers known as the Mirefolk, who claim they need it for their own sick leader.

**Stage 3: Decision**
- The player must decide how to handle the situation, balancing the needs of the villagers against those of the Mirefolk.

**Solution 1: Return the Medicine to Elara**
- **Action:** The player can choose to retrieve the medicine by force or negotiation, returning it to Elara.
- **Consequence:** The villagers are saved, and Elara is grateful, offering a discount on her herbal services. However, the Mirefolk's leader dies, leading to tensions and possible skirmishes with the villagers in the future. The player gains reputation with the villagers but loses it with the Mirefolk.

**Solution 2: Negotiate a Compromise**
- **Action:** The player mediates a deal where Elara agrees to help both the villagers and the Mirefolk by crafting additional doses of medicine using her remaining ingredients, with the Mirefolk promising to supply rare herbs in return.
- **Consequence:** Both groups are saved, fostering a fragile peace and cooperation between the villagers and Mirefolk. The player gains reputation with both factions, and a new trade route is established, offering unique goods in the future.

**Solution 3: Support the Mirefolk**
- **Action:** The player decides to help the Mirefolk and ensures their leader receives the medicine.
- **Consequence:** The Mirefolk leader survives and rewards the player with a unique artifact. However, the villagers suffer losses, and Elara, feeling betrayed, refuses to aid the player in the future. The player gains reputation with the Mirefolk but becomes an outcast among the villagers, possibly facing hostility when returning to Shadowfen.
