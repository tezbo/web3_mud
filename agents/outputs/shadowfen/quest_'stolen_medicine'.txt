**Quest Title: "The Missing Cure"**

**Stage Breakdown:**

1. **Discovery:** 
   - The player learns that a shipment of medicine vital to treating a deadly swamp fever has been stolen from the village of Shadowfen. The village healer, Elder Vela, is desperate, as without the medicine, many in the village will perish.

2. **Investigation:**
   - The player must investigate leads and talk to key villagers. Clues suggest that a local bandit group, the Mirethieves, is responsible. However, suspicion also falls on a rival healer from a nearby village, claiming Shadowfen hoards the medicine.

3. **Resolution:**
   - The player tracks down the stolen medicine to the Mirethieves' hideout. However, they discover the bandits are also suffering from the swamp fever and are using the medicine for their own. The player must decide how to handle the situation.

**Solutions:**

1. **Direct Confrontation:**
   - The player can choose to fight the Mirethieves and reclaim the medicine for Shadowfen.
   - **Consequences:** The villagers receive the medicine, Elder Vela rewards the player, and the Mirethieves are weakened. However, the bandit threat persists, and they may seek revenge later, attacking Shadowfen more aggressively.

2. **Negotiate a Truce:**
   - The player can attempt to mediate between Shadowfen and the Mirethieves, proposing that some medicine is shared in return for protection or labor from the bandits.
   - **Consequences:** Both groups benefit, reducing tension in the region. The bandits become allies, offering occasional assistance. However, some villagers may distrust the player for negotiating with criminals.

3. **Expose the Rival Healer:**
   - The player discovers evidence that the rival healer orchestrated the theft to damage Shadowfen’s reputation. The player can expose this plot.
   - **Consequences:** The rival healer is discredited, and Shadowfen’s reputation is restored. However, tensions rise between the villages, potentially leading to future conflicts. The bandits, still in possession of some medicine, are left unchecked.

**Lore Tie-ins:**
- The medicine is crafted using Threadsinging techniques, an ancient art now rare due to The Sundering.
- Shadowfen lies near a contested realm, making it a strategic location for various factions, including the bandits.
- The swamp fever is a lingering effect of The Sundering, which warped parts of the land and its flora.
