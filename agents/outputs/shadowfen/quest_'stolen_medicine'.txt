   - The player encounters Elara, a healer in Shadowfen, distraught over stolen medicine intended for the swamp fever outbreak affecting the village. She suspects a group of outlaws known as the Marsh Reavers, who have been seen nearby.

2. **Stage 2: Unraveling Motives**
   - The player investigates the Marsh Reavers' camp and discovers that the medicine was indeed taken. However, it becomes clear that the outlaws are not using the medicine for profit or harm but are attempting to treat their own sick members who are also suffering from swamp fever.

3. **Stage 3: Decision at Dusk**
   - The player must decide how to handle the situation, balancing the needs of the village and the outlaws.

   - The player chooses to help the Marsh Reavers by securing additional medicine from Elara for both the village and the outlaws.
   - **Consequences:** 
     - The player gains the trust of the Marsh Reavers, opening future quests where they offer unique services or information.
     - The village initially distrusts the player for aiding outlaws, leading to a minor reputation hit, but relations improve as both groups recover.

2. **Solution 2: Retrieve and Return**

     - The player gains a reputation as a skilled mediator, leading to future opportunities to resolve conflicts in Shadowfen and beyond.

**Tying to World Lore:**
- The swamp fever is a consequence of "The Sundering," a cataclysmic event that disrupted natural balances, giving context to the disease's virulence.
- The Marsh Reavers are former villagers who turned to outlaw life after being displaced by realm conflicts over resources exacerbated by Threadsinging, a form of magic that is altering the landscape.
