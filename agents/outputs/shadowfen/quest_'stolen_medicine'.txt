**Stage Breakdown:**

1. **Investigate the Theft:**
   - The player arrives in Shadowfen to find the villagers in distress. The only healer, Elder Kael, informs them that a recent shipment of rare medicinal herbs has been stolen. Without it, many ill villagers will suffer.

2. **Confront the Mireblood Clan:**
