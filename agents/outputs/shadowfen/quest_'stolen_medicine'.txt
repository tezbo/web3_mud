The herbs were last seen in the possession of a local bandit group known to hide in the ancient ruins of the Sundering.

2. **Investigation and Confrontation:**
   - The player must navigate through Shadowfen to locate the bandit hideout. Along the way, they interact with various denizens of the swamp, including a thread singer who offers cryptic advice about a hidden path. Upon reaching the ruins, the player discovers that the bandits are not mere thieves but are using the herbs to treat their own ailing leader, who is crucial to maintaining peace among the bandit factions.
