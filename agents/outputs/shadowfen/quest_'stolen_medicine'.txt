**Quest Title: "The Cure Conundrum"**

**Stage Breakdown:**

1. **Stage 1: The Disappearance**
   - In the murky swamps of Shadowfen, the player encounters Eldra, a frazzled herbalist. She explains that a shipment of rare medicine, crucial for treating a deadly swamp fever outbreak, has been stolen. Eldra suspects either the rival herbalist, Varik, or the desperate swamp raiders.

2. **Stage 2: Following the Trail**
   - The player must investigate the theft by gathering clues. This involves speaking with Varik, who vehemently denies any involvement, and tracking down the swamp raiders in their hideout. Evidence points to both parties having motives: Varik stands to profit if Eldra's medicine fails, while the raiders might have stolen it out of desperation to treat their own.

3. **Stage 3: The Decision**
   - The player finds the medicine hidden in the raiders' camp. However, Varik's assistant is also present, trying to retrieve it secretly. The player must decide how to resolve the situation.

**Solutions and Consequences:**

1. **Solution A: Return the Medicine to Eldra**
   - The player retrieves the medicine and returns it directly to Eldra, ignoring Varik's assistant. 
   - Consequences: The swamp fever is contained, and Eldra rewards the player. Varik's reputation is tarnished, impacting his business. The swamp raiders remain untreated, leading to further tensions in Shadowfen.

2. **Solution B: Aid the Raiders**
   - The player chooses to leave some of the medicine with the raiders, allowing them to treat their sick, and then returns the rest to Eldra.
   - Consequences: Eldra is disappointed but understands the player's choice. The raiders are grateful, offering future assistance in navigating the swamps. However, the shortage means some villagers remain untreated, leading to mistrust towards outsiders.

3. **Solution C: Expose Varik**
   - The player gathers evidence from the raiders and Varik's assistant to expose Varik's involvement in the theft.
   - Consequences: Eldra is relieved to have the medicine and grateful to the player. Varik is driven out of business due to his unethical practices. The raiders, having been falsely accused, gain some respect and potential trade opportunities with the villagers.

**World Ties:**
- The quest references The Sundering, as the swamp's harsh environment is a result of the ancient event.
- The realm's tensions reflect the ongoing conflicts, with the player's choices influencing the delicate balance of power and trust in Shadowfen.
