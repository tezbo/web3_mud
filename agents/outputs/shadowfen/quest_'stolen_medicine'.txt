- **Objective:** Speak with Eldra to learn more about the theft and gather clues.

**Stage 2: The Culprits**
- **Investigation:** Players can investigate the scene of the theft and interview villagers. They learn of a group of outcast swamp dwellers, led by a figure named Varik, who might be responsible. Varik's people have been ostracized and struggling with their own outbreak.

  2. **Side with Eldra:** Players can assist Eldra in retrieving the stolen medicine by stealth or force, ensuring all supplies are returned to the village.
     - **Consequences:** This choice secures immediate safety for the village, but Varik's people become hostile. Future quests involve dealing with increased tensions and possible sabotage from the outcasts.
  3. **Aid Varik's People:** Players can choose to help Varik's group by finding alternative resources or crafting additional medicine, allowing them to keep the stolen supplies.
     - **Consequences:** This choice wins the loyalty of Varik's people, who become valuable allies. However, the village initially suffers increased illness, and players must help stabilize the situation with additional side quests.
