**Quest Title: The Cure's Cost**

**Stage Breakdown:**

1. **Discovery:** 
   - The player stumbles upon a distraught healer, Elara, in the marshy village of Shadowfen. Her supply of rare medicine, essential for treating a deadly swamp fever outbreak, has been stolen.
   - Elara suspects it was taken by a desperate local, Jorvik, whose family is also suffering from the fever.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Players can gather information by speaking to villagers, learning about Jorvik's situation and possible hiding places.
   - They discover that Jorvik is hiding in an abandoned, overgrown shrine deep in the swamp.

3. **Confrontation:**
   - The player finds Jorvik and can choose how to resolve the conflict.

**Solutions:**

1. **Persuasion and Mediation:**
   - The player convinces Jorvik to return the medicine by promising to help his family another way, perhaps by gathering herbs or seeking another healer.
   - **Consequences:** 
     - Jorvik returns the medicine, saving the village. Elara becomes an ally, offering healing services in the future.
     - Jorvik's family struggles but survives with the player's help. The village sees the player as a hero for preventing a feud.

2. **Stealth and Retribution:**
   - The player waits until Jorvik leaves his hiding spot, then steals the medicine back without a confrontation.
   - **Consequences:** 
     - The village is saved, but Jorvik's family suffers, leading to resentment against the player. 
     - Elara remains neutral, but some villagers view the player with suspicion, affecting future interactions.

3. **Confrontation and Negotiation:**
   - The player confronts Jorvik directly and offers to trade supplies or services in exchange for the medicine.
   - **Consequences:** 
     - The trade satisfies both parties, and the village gets the medicine.
     - Jorvik becomes a reluctant ally, occasionally providing tips or assistance in future quests, though he remains wary.

**Ripple Effects:**
- The player's reputation in Shadowfen will change, influencing future quests and interactions. Acknowledgment will vary from gratitude to suspicion, affecting access to resources and information within the village.
