**Quest Title: The Shadowfen Cure**

**Stage Breakdown:**

1. **Stage 1: The Missing Shipment**
   - The player arrives in Shadowfen and overhears a heated argument between Healer Aelara and Merchant Jorin. Aelara insists Jorin's shipment of rare herbs meant for medicine has been stolen en route. Without it, the village is at risk of a deadly outbreak.
   - Aelara tasks the player with discovering the fate of the shipment. The player learns that the shipment was last seen near the Whispering Bog, a notorious hiding ground for bandits.

2. **Stage 2: The Bandits' Bargain**
   - The player infiltrates the bandit camp in the Whispering Bog. Upon discovery, the bandit leader, Ralvik, offers a deal: he will return the herbs if the player helps him overthrow a rival bandit leader. Alternatively, the player can choose to steal back the herbs or negotiate their release.
   - The player learns from a captured bandit that Jorin might have orchestrated the theft to drive up prices.

3. **Stage 3: Resolution and Ramifications**
   - Depending on the player's actions, the herbs are returned to Shadowfen, or the situation takes a different turn.

**Solutions and Consequences:**

1. **Solution 1: Aid the Bandits**
   - The player assists Ralvik in overthrowing his rival. The herbs are returned, and the bandits now control the Whispering Bog.
   - **Consequences:** The bandits remain a threat but are now friendly to the player, offering discounts on black market goods. Shadowfen receives the herbs, but rumors of the player's alliance with bandits affect their reputation negatively.

2. **Solution 2: Steal Back the Herbs**
   - The player sneaks into the bandit camp and retrieves the herbs without making any deals.
   - **Consequences:** The player becomes a hero in Shadowfen, and Aelara offers a permanent discount on her healing services. However, the bandits become hostile, attacking travelers more frequently, and the player is now on their most-wanted list.

3. **Solution 3: Expose the Merchant**
   - The player investigates and confronts Jorin, revealing his scheme to profit from the crisis. The player presents evidence to Aelara and the village council.
   - **Consequences:** Jorin is exiled from Shadowfen, and the player gains the trust of the villagers. Aelara rewards the player with a unique potion recipe. However, Jorin vows revenge and aligns with a larger trade cartel, complicating future trade in the region.

**Tied to World Lore:**
The quest ties into the larger conflict of resource scarcity caused by The Sundering. The bandits' presence in the Whispering Bog is partly due to displaced populations and disrupted trade routes, adding layers to the world's ongoing struggles.
