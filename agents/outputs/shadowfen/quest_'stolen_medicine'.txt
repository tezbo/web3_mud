**Quest Title: The Cure's Quandary**

**Stage 1: Discovery and Inquiry**
The player arrives in the murky village of Mirewatch within Shadowfen, where they learn from Elder Voska that a crucial shipment of medicine, intended to combat a spreading swamp fever, has been stolen. The villagers are desperate, and tensions are high as suspicions about the thief's identity circulate.

**Stage 2: Investigation and Decision**
The player investigates three leads:
- A local hunter named Ralgar, who was seen near the delivery site.
- A group of bandits known to raid supply routes.
- A rival healer, Lira, who opposes Elder Voska's methods.

**Stage 3: Resolution and Consequences**

**Solution 1: Confront the Hunter**
The player confronts Ralgar, who admits he took the medicine to barter with the bandits for his captured brother. The player can:
- Aid Ralgar in rescuing his brother, retrieving the medicine in the process.
  - **Consequences:** Ralgar becomes an ally, offering hunting skills to aid the village. The bandit threat diminishes as they lose leverage.
- Expose Ralgar to the village.
  - **Consequences:** Ralgar is ostracized, creating a divide. The village is saved, but the fever’s spread renews as the bandits retaliate.

**Solution 2: Negotiate with the Bandits**
The player tracks down the bandits and negotiates a deal, offering either coin or a favor in exchange for the medicine.
- **Consequences:** The bandits agree to cease raids temporarily, but the player owes them a future favor. The village is saved, but Elder Voska is wary of the player's associations.

**Solution 3: Uncover the Rival Healer’s Plot**
The player discovers Lira has taken the medicine to discredit Elder Voska and promote her own remedies. The player can:
- Reveal Lira’s plan, restoring the medicine to the village.
  - **Consequences:** The village turns against Lira, strengthening Elder Voska’s leadership. Lira leaves, seeking allies among the Threadsinging sect, potentially creating future conflict.
- Support Lira’s initiative.
  - **Consequences:** Lira’s remedies prove effective, and she gains influence. Elder Voska steps down, altering the village's leadership dynamics and opening new storylines involving Lira's methods and her ties to the Threadsinging.

**World Tie-in:**
The quest ties into the broader lore, as the swamp fever is a byproduct of the ancient Sundering, and the player's choices may uncover or obscure secrets about the realm's past embedded in Shadowfen's history.
