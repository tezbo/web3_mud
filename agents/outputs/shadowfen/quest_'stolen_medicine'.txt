**Quest Title: The Cure's Cost**

**Stage Breakdown:**

1. **Stage 1: Discovery in Shadowfen**
   - Hook: The player encounters a distraught healer, Elara, in the swampy region of Shadowfen. She explains that a vital shipment of rare medicine, meant to treat a deadly outbreak in her village, has been stolen by bandits.
   - Objective: Investigate the bandits' camp in the heart of Shadowfen to recover the medicine.

2. **Stage 2: The Bandits' Dilemma**
   - The player finds the bandits' camp and overhears a conversation. The bandits reveal that they stole the medicine to save their own ailing leader, Jarek, who has been infected by the same disease plaguing Elara's village.
   - Objective: Decide how to handle the situation with the bandits.

3. **Stage 3: Resolution and Consequences**
   - Depending on the player's choice, resolve the situation with either the bandits or Elara, and face the consequences of that decision.

**Solutions:**

1. **Solution A: Negotiate a Compromise**
   - The player mediates between Elara and the bandits, proposing that half of the medicine is used to treat Jarek, and half is returned to the village.
   - Consequence: Both groups survive, but tensions remain high. The bandits, feeling indebted, may offer future assistance in other conflicts within Shadowfen. However, the village's recovery is slower, leading to some resentment toward the player.

2. **Solution B: Side with Elara**
   - The player decides to confront the bandits, using force or diplomacy to recover all the stolen medicine for the village.
   - Consequence: The village recovers quickly, and Elara becomes a strong ally, offering her healing skills to the player. However, the bandits, now weakened and without a leader, scatter into the swamp, leading to increased lawlessness and future dangers in Shadowfen.

3. **Solution C: Aid the Bandits**
   - The player chooses to help the bandits by curing Jarek with the medicine, leaving Elara's village to fend for themselves.
   - Consequence: The bandits become a powerful ally, providing the player with access to secret routes and resources in Shadowfen. However, the village suffers greatly, leading to the disease spreading and causing distrust and anger toward the player from the local populace.

Each solution ties back into the broader themes of the world, such as the moral complexity stemming from decisions made in desperation and the impact of individual choices on community dynamics.
