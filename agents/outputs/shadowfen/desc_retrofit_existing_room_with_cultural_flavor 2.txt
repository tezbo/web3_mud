In the dimly lit chamber, veils of mist slither across the stone floor, whispering against the rusted iron fixtures that jut from the walls like forgotten relics. The air is heavy with the musk of damp earth and the faint acrid scent of decaying foliage. A soft, insistent drip echoes in the distance, each drop a heartbeat in the silence, while the chill of the room clings to your skin like a damp shroud. Shadows twist and dance along the walls, their shapes teasing the eye with fleeting, ungraspable forms.
