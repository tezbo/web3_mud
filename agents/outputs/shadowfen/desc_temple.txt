The temple stands shrouded in a perpetual veil of mist, its once-grand columns now cloaked in creeping moss and rust-red vines. A low murmur of distant chants echoes through the air, mingling with the soft drip of water from the stone ceiling, each drop echoing like a whispered secret. The air is thick with the earthy scent of damp earth and the faint, acrid tang of ancient incense, long burned out. As you step inside, the flagstones are cool and slick beneath your feet, their surfaces worn smooth by centuries of pilgrimage, each step infused with the weight of forgotten prayers.
