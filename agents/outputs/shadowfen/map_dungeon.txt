### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose:** The Great Hall serves as the central hub, ensuring logical flow between high-importance rooms like the Armory and the Torture Chamber. The Guard Barracks is appropriately placed to serve as both a living area and quick access point for guard deployment.
  
- **Exploration vs. Convenience:** The Secret Exit rewards players who take the time to explore beyond the obvious paths, creating an opportunity for intrigue and storytelling through environmental design.

- **Realism and Storytelling:** The layout reflects a functional yet oppressive environment, emphasizing security and control. The gradual progression from public areas to more secretive locations aligns with traditional dungeon narratives.

- **Vertical Space Usage:** The design is flat but maintains complexity through layered access, emphasizing horizontal exploration with a hidden vertical element in the Secret Exit.
