### Room List with Exits:

1. **Entrance**

2. **Antechamber**
   - Exits: North to Entrance, South to Guardroom
   - Purpose: A small room that acts as a buffer between the outside and the more secured parts of the dungeon. It contains remnants of old banners and broken furniture.

3. **Guardroom**
   - Exits: North to Antechamber, East to Storeroom, South to Main Hall
   - Purpose: Once housing the dungeon guards, this room has remnants of old weaponry and armor. Provides a natural intersection for players to decide their next path.

4. **Storeroom**
   - Exits: West to Guardroom
   - Purpose: Contains crates and barrels with some useful supplies and a few minor treasures. Encourages players to explore side areas for rewards.

5. **Main Hall**

   - Purpose: The largest room in the dungeon, used as a central area for gatherings or rituals. Decorated with ancient symbols and partially collapsed stone pillars.

   - Purpose: A secretive area partially hidden behind a loose stone wall in the Main Hall. Contains a modest treasure or key item for deeper lore, rewarding keen explorers.

### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose:

- **Flow and Exploration**: The dungeon layout encourages exploration through a central path (Guardroom to Main Hall) with offshoots (Storeroom and Hidden Alcove) that reward curiosity. The storeroom is easily accessible, providing a small reward early on, while the Hidden Alcove requires players to pay attention to environmental cues for discovery.

- **Central Hub**: The Guardroom serves as the central hub, with multiple exits allowing players to make meaningful choices about their progression.

- **Pacing**: The design clusters the main path from the Entrance to the Main Hall, with the Hidden Alcove providing a final, optional area for players who engage with the space more thoroughly.

- **Realism and Storytelling**: The logical flow from Entrance to Main Hall mirrors a realistic progression into the depths of the dungeon, with each room serving a believable purpose within the context of a fortified space.

- **Vertical Spaces**: Not utilized in this design, as the focus is on a horizontal exploration experience typical of a ground-level dungeon.

This layout provides a balanced mix of exploration, discovery, and logical progression, capturing the essence of a Shadowfen-style dungeon.
