### Room List with Exits

1. **Entrance**
   - Exits: East to Chamber of Shadows, South to Guard Room
   - Notes: A foreboding entryway with heavy, moss-covered stone doors. Sets the tone for the dungeon with dim lighting and the sound of dripping water echoing throughout.

2. **Chamber of Shadows**
   - Exits: West to Entrance, East to Dark Altar, South to Hidden Passage
   - Notes: The central hub of the dungeon, filled with flickering shadows cast by torchlight. It serves as a meeting point, with ominous carvings on the walls suggesting the presence of dark rituals.

3. **Dark Altar**
   - Exits: West to Chamber of Shadows
   - Notes: A sinister room dominated by an ancient altar used for shadowy rituals. The air is thick with the scent of incense, and whispers seem to echo from the walls. A key location for quests involving dark magic or forbidden knowledge.

4. **Guard Room**
   - Exits: North to Entrance, South to Prison Cells
   - Notes: A small, cramped room with worn furniture and weapon racks. Guards are stationed here to prevent prisoners from escaping, and players might find clues or keys here for freeing captives.

5. **Prison Cells**
   - Exits: North to Guard Room
   - Notes: Dank and oppressive, with several cells lining the walls. Each cell tells a story of its own, with etchings from former prisoners. Players can find side quests or rescue missions here.

6. **Hidden Passage**
   - Exits: North to Chamber of Shadows
   - Notes: A secretive corridor accessed via a concealed lever in the Chamber of Shadows. Leads to a small hidden chamber with a treasure chest, rewarding players who take the time to explore.

### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Flow:** The Entrance leads directly into the Chamber of Shadows, establishing it as the main hub. From here, players can choose to explore the Dark Altar for quests or delve into the Guard Room and Prison Cells for more narrative-driven encounters.
  
- **Purpose:** Each room serves a distinct purpose, with the Chamber of Shadows providing central connectivity. The Dark Altar and Hidden Passage encourage exploration and uncovering secrets, while the Guard Room and Prison Cells offer story elements and side quests.

- **Exploration vs. Convenience:** The map is designed to encourage exploration without being overly complex. Hidden Passage rewards curiosity, while clear paths ensure players don't get lost.

- **Realism and Storytelling:** The layout reflects a logical progression from entrance to depth, with rooms serving functions typical of a dungeon setting (guarding, imprisoning, ritualistic). The environmental storytelling is enhanced by room-specific details, such as carvings, etchings, and ambient sounds.
