### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose**: The central hub, Chamber of Echoes, draws players in with its mysterious allure and leads them deeper into the dungeon. The main path through the Hall of Whispers and the Catacomb Entrance guides players naturally, while the Guard Post and Hidden Alcove provide opportunities for exploration and discovery.
- **Exploration vs. Convenience**: The layout encourages exploration with the Hidden Alcove being off the main path, rewarding players with lore and items. The Guard Post offers a strategic vantage point, hinting at the dungeon's defensive past.
- **Realism and Storytelling**: The spatial design reflects a once-defended, now-abandoned structure with logical connections between rooms. The Sinking Chamber's partial submersion adds an element of environmental storytelling, suggesting ongoing decay and mystery in the Shadowfen style.
- **Vertical Space**: Though primarily horizontal in this layout, the Sinking Chamber's water level introduces a vertical element for potential future expansions, such as deeper submerged passages or hidden underwater treasures.
