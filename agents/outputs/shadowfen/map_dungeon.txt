### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Central Hub (Gloomroot Chambers)**: This room acts as a major junction, allowing players to choose different paths, fostering a sense of adventure and discovery.
- **Flow**: Starting from the Chamber of Echoes, players naturally progress towards the more challenging areas. The central Gloomroot Chambers serve as a decision point to explore optional areas.
- **Discovery**: Hidden paths like the one leading to the Cursed Crypt reward players for thorough exploration.
- **Pacing**: The layout ensures that players experience a gradual increase in difficulty and complexity, with each room offering distinct challenges and atmospheres.
- **Realism**: The design reflects a believable underground environment with naturally interconnected rooms.
- **Vertical Space**: Although this map doesn't explicitly use vertical spaces, the idea of descending deeper into the dungeon adds a vertical conceptual layer.

This design effectively balances exploration with convenience, rewarding players who take the time to explore every nook and cranny of the dungeon.
