### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The dungeon's central hub is the Main Chamber, which allows players to explore the more dangerous or rewarding areas at their own pace. The Entrance Hall and Main Chamber are essential for navigation, while the Guard Room and Prison Cell offer side narratives and smaller rewards.
  
- **Discovery:** The Secret Passage is a hidden element that encourages players to pay attention to their surroundings, rewarding exploration with access to the Treasure Room.

- **Pacing:** The layout encourages players to first explore the Entrance Hall and Main Chamber, with the option to delve into side rooms before uncovering the Secret Passage.

- **Realism:** The structure of the dungeon is logical, with the Entrance Hall leading to a central Main Chamber, reminiscent of old fortifications. The Guard Room and Prison Cell are naturally placed along the defensive and punitive lines.

- **Vertical Space:** The use of vertical movement through the Secret Passage adds depth and complexity to the exploration, simulating the experience of unearthing hidden secrets within the dungeon.
