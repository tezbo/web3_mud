Design Notes on Flow and Purpose:

- **Flow**: The dungeon's layout is designed to naturally guide players from the Entrance to the Crypt, with the Main Hall serving as a key hub. The Guard Room acts as a central connection point, allowing for strategic choices in movement.
- **Purpose**: Each room serves a distinct purpose that contributes to the overall narrative of the dungeon. For example, the Prison Cells provide backstory and hidden lore, while the Storage Room rewards players with resources.
- **Exploration**: The design encourages exploration through hidden messages in the Prison Cells and potential treasures in the Storage Room, creating a sense of mystery and reward.
- **Realism**: The layout is logical, with guards stationed near the entrance and valuable resources stored securely. The Crypt's placement as the final, deepest room adds an element of danger and climax to the exploration.
- **Vertical Space**: While this district is primarily horizontal, the sense of descending deeper into the dungeon is created through the progression from the Entrance to the Crypt.

This Shadowfen Dungeon District offers an engaging and narrative-rich exploration experience, blending logical design with opportunities for discovery and adventure.
