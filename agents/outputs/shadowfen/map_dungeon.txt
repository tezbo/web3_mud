2. **Guard Post**
   - Exits: West to Entrance, East to Main Chamber, South to Prison Cells

3. **Main Chamber**
   - Exits: West to Guard Post, East to Alchemist's Lab

   - Notes: A secret tunnel leading from the Prison Cells, discovered by perceptive players. It serves as a shortcut or escape route, potentially bypassing the Guard Post on return trips.

### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Flow**: The layout encourages players to first pass through the Guard Post and into the Main Chamber, establishing a main path. From the Main Chamber, players can opt to explore deeper into the Alchemist's Lab or take a detour to the Prison Cells, rewarding curiosity.
  
- **Purpose**: The dungeon's design provides a balance of challenge and reward. Each room has a distinct role—Guard Post as a barrier, Main Chamber as a hub, Alchemist's Lab for discovery, and Prison Cells for narrative depth. The Hidden Passage adds an element of surprise and a reward for thorough exploration.

- **Shadowfen Style**: This district reflects the eerie and mysterious atmosphere typical of Shadowfen, with a focus on dark magic and forgotten histories woven into the space. Each room contributes to the narrative of a once-vibrant location now steeped in decay and secrecy.

- **Vertical Space**: The inclusion of the Hidden Passage accessible from the Prison Cells adds a layer of vertical complexity, encouraging players to think about the space in three dimensions and rewarding those who investigate thoroughly.
