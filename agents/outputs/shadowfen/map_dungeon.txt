### Design Notes

- **Flow and Exploration**: The design encourages a natural flow from the Entrance Hall through to the deeper parts of the dungeon with opportunities for discovery. The Secret Chamber and Ancient Altar reward players who explore beyond the main paths.
  
- **Purpose and Atmosphere**: Each room serves a distinct narrative or gameplay purpose, whether introducing players to the dungeon (Entrance Hall), providing rewards (Treasure Vault), or challenging players with environmental hazards (Flooded Passage).

- **Realism and Storytelling**: The layout reflects a logical progression deeper into the dungeon, culminating at the Ancient Altar. The flooded and guarded themes are consistent with a Shadowfen style, creating an immersive experience.

This district design balances exploration with a clear sense of progression, encouraging players to delve deeper while rewarding those who seek out its hidden secrets.
