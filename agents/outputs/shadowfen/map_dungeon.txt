### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Flow**: The Entrance Hall serves as the central hub, from where players can choose to explore different paths. The Guard Room and Cell Block provide thematic consistency for a dungeon.
- **Exploration and Discovery**: Hidden Vault as a vertical exploration reward, Torture Chamber's verticality creates a multi-layered experience.
- **Pacing**: The layout encourages players to revisit rooms like the Entrance Hall and Cell Block, maintaining engagement and encouraging exploration.
- **Realism**: The placement of the Guard Room and Armory near the entrance provides a logical defense layout. The Hidden Vault as a secret area adds to the lore and realism of a dungeon setting.

This design balances exploration with storytelling, providing players with a compelling environment to explore in the Shadowfen style.
