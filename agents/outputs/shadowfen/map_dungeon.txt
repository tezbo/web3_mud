**Room List and Exits**

1. **D1: Entrance Hall**
   - Exits: East to D2, South to D4

2. **D2: Guard Post**
   - Exits: West to D1, East to D3, South to D5
   - Purpose: A checkpoint manned by spectral guards. Provides a sense of danger and sets the tone for the dungeon. Contains a hidden lever that unlocks a secret passage to D6.

3. **D3: Armory**
   - Exits: West to D2
   - Purpose: Storage for old, rusted weapons and armor. A chance for players to find useful gear. The room is cluttered with racks and crates, creating a maze-like feel.

4. **D4: Prison Cells**
   - Exits: North to D1, South to D6
   - Purpose: A grim area lined with barred cells. Players can find clues about the dungeon's history and possibly rescue a captive NPC for a side quest.

5. **D5: Ritual Chamber**
   - Exits: North to D2
   - Purpose: A dark, foreboding room with an altar at its center. The room is used for sinister rituals, offering players a mystery to uncover. Contains a puzzle that, when solved, reveals a hidden cache of magical items.

6. **D6: Hidden Treasury**
   - Exits: North to D4
   - Purpose: A secret room filled with treasure and guarded by a powerful spirit. Accessed either through solving the puzzle in D5 or by discovering the hidden passage from D2. Provides a significant reward for exploration and problem-solving.

**Design Notes**

- **Flow and Exploration:** The dungeon is structured to encourage exploration and discovery. Players naturally move from the entrance through the guard post, with optional detours to the armory and ritual chamber before reaching the prison cells and hidden treasury.
  
- **Central Hub Concept:** D2 acts as a mini-hub, with multiple exits leading to other rooms, allowing players to make choices about their path.

- **Pacing and Discovery:** The layout provides a balance between linear progression and optional exploration. Hidden elements in D2 and D5 reward players who pay attention to details.

- **Realism:** The dungeon's layout reflects its purpose as a fortified underground complex. The placement of rooms such as the guard post and prison cells make logical sense within the context of a dungeon environment.

- **Vertical Space:** Though primarily horizontal, the hidden treasury (D6) adds a layer of vertical complexity by being a concealed lower chamber, enhancing the sense of depth and discovery.
