### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The dungeon is designed to lead players from the Entrance Hall through a logical progression of rooms, with the Guard Post acting as a central hub for branching paths.
- **Exploration:** Hidden Alcove rewards keen players who explore the Supplies Room thoroughly. The layout encourages players to investigate all areas with a mix of linear and branching paths.
- **Theme:** The Shadowfen style is reflected in the oppressive atmosphere and decayed state of the dungeon. Each room tells part of the story of a once-functioning, now-abandoned facility.
- **Realism:** The layout makes physical sense as a security-focused dungeon with a central guard area, prisoner management spaces, and storage facilities.
- **Pacing:** The central Guard Post serves to cluster the main paths, while the Supplies Room and Hidden Alcove offer a break from the tension with discovery and reward.
