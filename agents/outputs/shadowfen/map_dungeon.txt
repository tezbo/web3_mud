   - **Notes:** A small, fortified room with guards stationed to protect the dungeon. Contains weapons and basic supplies.

4. **Corridor**
   - **Exits:** North to Antechamber, South to Prison Block
   - **Notes:** A narrow, winding corridor that leads deeper into the dungeon. The walls are lined with torches, and the air grows colder as one progresses southward.

   - **Notes:** The end reward for those who uncover the hidden path. Filled with ancient artifacts and guarded by traps.

### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The Antechamber serves as the central hub, with multiple exits providing various paths to explore. The Guard Room is logically placed to protect the entrance. The Corridor leads to the Prison Block, creating a sense of progression into the depth of the dungeon.
  
- **Discovery:** The Hidden Passage encourages exploration and rewards players with a shortcut to the Treasure Room, bypassing the main path through the Corridor.

- **Purpose:** Each room serves a specific function, maintaining a realistic layout: guards near the entrance, prisoners deeper inside, and treasure hidden and protected.

- **Pacing:** The layout balances exploration and convenience, with the Treasure Room and Prison Block requiring players to choose between the direct path or the hidden, rewarding route.
