Certainly! Here's an ASCII map design for a 6-room district called 'Dungeon' in the Shadowfen style:

```
    [Chamber of Echoes]
           |
   [Ancient Hallway] -- [The Pit]
           |
   [Hall of Sorrow] -- [Crypt of Whispers]
           |
     [Guardian's Lair]
```

**Room List with Exits:**

1. **Chamber of Echoes**
   - Exits: South to Ancient Hallway
   - Purpose: Entry point with eerie acoustics; sets the tone with sounds that hint at the lurking dangers.

2. **Ancient Hallway**
   - Exits: North to Chamber of Echoes, South to Hall of Sorrow, East to The Pit
   - Purpose: Main thoroughfare; introduces players to the core of the dungeon. Contains faded murals that narrate ancient history.

3. **The Pit**
   - Exits: West to Ancient Hallway
   - Purpose: Optional, challenging side area; a deep chasm with a rickety bridge. Rewards careful navigation with unique loot.

4. **Hall of Sorrow**
   - Exits: North to Ancient Hallway, East to Crypt of Whispers, South to Guardian's Lair
   - Purpose: Central hub for the deeper dungeon areas; statues of weeping figures add to the somber atmosphere.

5. **Crypt of Whispers**
   - Exits: West to Hall of Sorrow
   - Purpose: Hidden side chamber; requires solving a puzzle to enter. Contains echoes of ancient secrets and a rare item.

6. **Guardian's Lair**
   - Exits: North to Hall of Sorrow
   - Purpose: End-point of the main path; home to a formidable guardian blocking the treasure vault. Players must defeat it to claim the major treasure.

**Design Notes:**

- **Flow and Purpose:** The dungeon's design encourages exploration through its main path (Chamber of Echoes -> Ancient Hallway -> Hall of Sorrow -> Guardian's Lair). The optional paths (The Pit and Crypt of Whispers) offer rewards for those willing to explore further.

- **Central Hubs:** The Ancient Hallway acts as a central hub from which players can choose to continue deeper or explore side passages.

- **Discovery and Storytelling:** The murals in the Ancient Hallway and the statues in the Hall of Sorrow provide storytelling elements that immerse players in the history of the dungeon.

- **Pacing and Realism:** The layout balances exploration and challenge, with a logical progression deeper into the dungeon. The physical connections make sense, with the flow leading naturally from entry to climax.

- **Vertical Space:** While this design focuses on horizontal exploration, The Pit adds a vertical element with its chasm, enhancing the sense of depth and danger.
