Room List with Exits and Design Notes:

1. Entrance Hall
   Exits: East to [2], South to [4]
   Notes: This is the starting point for players entering the dungeon. It sets the tone with damp stone walls and flickering torchlight. The dual exits encourage exploration and decision-making.

2. Guardroom
   Exits: West to [1], East to [3]
   Notes: A defensive checkpoint with remnants of old weaponry and armor. Players can learn about the dungeon’s past inhabitants here. It's a straight path but offers clues about hidden secrets elsewhere.

3. Chamber of Shadows
   Exits: West to [2], South to [5]
   Notes: A mysterious room filled with eerie shadows cast by an unknown light source. The atmosphere hints at the presence of hidden paths or secrets. Players will find cryptic symbols that suggest a secret mechanism.

4. Storage Room
   Exits: North to [1], East to [5], South to [6]
   Notes: Filled with crates and barrels, this room offers a hiding spot for players to discover a hidden lever that opens a secret passage to a treasure room. The multiple exits provide a sense of depth and complexity.

5. Hall of Echoes
   Exits: West to [4], North to [3]
   Notes: Named for its peculiar acoustics, this room plays tricks on the ears. It serves as a hub for players to reflect on their journey with echoes of past encounters. The acoustics hint at another hidden path.

6. Hidden Treasure Room
   Exits: North to [4] (hidden entrance)
   Notes: Accessible only through a secret passage activated in the Storage Room. It rewards exploration with treasure and lore items that enhance the storytelling of the dungeon.

Design Notes:
- Flow: The design leads players from the Entrance Hall into a series of interconnected rooms, encouraging both linear progression and exploration.
- Discovery: The layout includes hidden paths and a secret room [6] to reward those who explore thoroughly.
- Pacing: Rooms [1]-[3] provide initial exploration, while [4]-[6] deepen the mystery and complexity.
- Realism: The layout resembles a functional, albeit abandoned, fortification with logical room connections.
- Vertical Space: Not used in this design to maintain simplicity and focus on horizontal exploration.

This design balances exploration and convenience, creating a sense of mystery and reward for players who delve deep into the Shadowfen Dungeon.
