### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Central Hub:** The Main Hall acts as the central hub, providing multiple exits to encourage exploration and decision-making. This design ensures players naturally discover key locations.
  
- **Flow:** The linear path from Entrance to Treasure Vault is broken by the multiple choices offered in the Main Hall. This encourages players to explore, rather than rush to the end.

- **Discovery:** The Hidden Chamber is a secretive area that rewards players for paying attention to clues found in the Crypt. This adds depth and replayability.

- **Pacing:** Main challenges are spread across the Guard Room and Crypt, with the Hidden Chamber providing a narrative break before the final reward in the Treasure Vault.

- **Realism:** The layout mimics a logical underground structure with a main corridor and side paths, enhancing immersion.

- **Vertical Space:** Though the dungeon is on a single plane, the crypt's design provides a sense of depth and ancient history, reinforcing the Shadowfen style.
