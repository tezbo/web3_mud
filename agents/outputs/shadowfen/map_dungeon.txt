### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The Antechamber serves as the central hub, allowing easy access to the critical areas of the dungeon. This layout encourages exploration by leading players naturally from the Guard Post into the more notorious areas.
- **Purpose:** The design reflects a foreboding and oppressive environment, typical of Shadowfen's treacherous landscapes. The Guard Post and Antechamber set the stage for what lies deeper within, with the Cell Block and Torture Chamber illustrating the harsh realities of imprisonment and control.
- **Discovery:** The Warden's Office and Armory offer rewards for exploration, with keys and equipment that can assist players in their journey or escape.
- **Realism:** The layout makes sense logistically, with critical facilities like the Armory near the Guard Post and the Warden's Office overseeing the Cell Block. The Torture Chamber's location off the Antechamber emphasizes its secretive and grim function.
- **Pacing:** The central Antechamber clusters related rooms, while the linear progression from Guard Post to Cell Block and Warden's Office introduces a sense of depth and distance.
