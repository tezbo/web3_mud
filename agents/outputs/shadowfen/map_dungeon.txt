   - **Exits:** North to Entrance Hall, South to Cell Block, East to Armory, West to Hidden Passage
   - **Purpose:** Central hub of the dungeon, serves as a gathering place for players. Contains a throne or significant feature indicating leadership or control.

6. **Hidden Passage**

#### Design Notes:
- **Flow:** The Main Chamber acts as the central hub, allowing for easy navigation to key areas. Players naturally pass through it to access other rooms, making it a focal point.
  
- **Exploration vs. Convenience:** The Hidden Passage offers an optional path for players who seek to explore beyond the obvious, providing a sense of discovery and reward.

- **Storytelling:** Each room contributes to the narrative of a dark, oppressive environment where prisoners are kept and tortured. The Armory and Torture Room each provide context and backstory.

- **Realism:** The layout makes physical sense with functional spaces logically connected. The Cell Block is close to the Torture Room, while the Armory is adjacent to the Main Chamber for easy access by guards.

- **Pacing:** The path from the Entrance Hall to the Torture Room gradually immerses players deeper into the dungeon's atmosphere, with increasing tension and narrative impact.

This design creates a balanced dungeon experience, encouraging exploration while providing a logical and immersive environment.
