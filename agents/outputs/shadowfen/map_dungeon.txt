### Room List with Exits and Purpose

1. **Entrance**
   - **Exits:** South to Guard Room
   - **Purpose:** The entry point to the dungeon, guarded by heavy iron gates. Sets the tone with damp, earthy smells and flickering torchlight.

2. **Guard Room**
   - **Exits:** North to Entrance, South to Main Hall
   - **Purpose:** A small room where guards are stationed. Contains weapon racks and a modest table. It serves as a checkpoint, introducing a minor obstacle or encounter.

3. **Main Hall**
   - **Exits:** North to Guard Room, East to Hidden Alcove, South to Prison Cells
   - **Purpose:** The central hub of the dungeon, a vast, echoing chamber. It connects to various paths and is often filled with the sounds of distant water dripping. The architecture hints at forgotten grandeur.

4. **Hidden Alcove**
   - **Exits:** West to Main Hall
   - **Purpose:** A secret area concealed behind a tapestry or a loose stone. It rewards players who explore with a small cache of treasure or a unique item. 

5. **Prison Cells**
   - **Exits:** North to Main Hall, East to Secret Passage
   - **Purpose:** A series of dank cells with heavy, rusted bars. This area is filled with the remnants of past prisoners. It adds depth to the story, hinting at the dungeon's dark history.

6. **Secret Passage**
   - **Exits:** West to Prison Cells, South to Boss Chamber
   - **Purpose:** A narrow, winding corridor discovered by careful observation or solving a puzzle. It provides a shortcut or strategic advantage leading to the final area.

7. **Boss Chamber**
   - **Exits:** North to Secret Passage
   - **Purpose:** The final confrontation area. A large, ominous chamber with an oppressive atmosphere, perhaps dominated by a throne or altar. It serves as the climax of the dungeon's narrative.

### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Flow:** The design encourages players to explore multiple paths while maintaining a logical progression from entrance to the final boss. The central Main Hall allows for easy navigation and decision-making.
  
- **Discovery:** Hidden Alcove and Secret Passage reward exploration and curiosity. These areas provide strategic advantages or unique rewards, encouraging players to look beyond the obvious.

- **Purpose:** Each room serves a distinct role, contributing to the overall narrative of a once-great structure fallen into disrepair. The Guard Room and Prison Cells add to the lore, suggesting a past use as a holding facility.

- **Realism:** The layout reflects a plausible dungeon structure, with defensive measures (Guard Room) and a central gathering area (Main Hall) that support the dungeon's thematic consistency.

- **Vertical Space:** Although the map is primarily horizontal, the narrative and room descriptions can imply depth and height, such as the imposing nature of the Main Hall or the claustrophobic Secret Passage.
