### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Flow and Exploration**: The dungeon's design encourages players to delve deeper with a clear vertical progression, while also rewarding lateral exploration with the Hidden Alcove.
- **Atmosphere and Theming**: Each room contributes to the Shadowfen's distinct vibe—moist, echoing, and overgrown with nature reclaiming the space.
- **Discovery and Reward**: The Hidden Alcove and Treasure Lair provide motivation for exploration beyond the main path, with both practical and narrative rewards.
- **Pacing**: The design moves players from open spaces to more confined, challenging environments, creating a sense of progression and depth.
- **Realism and Immersion**: The logical sequence of rooms supports a narrative of an abandoned, nature-overrun dungeon, promoting immersion in the Shadowfen theme.
