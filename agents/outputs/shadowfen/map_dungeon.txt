### Room List with Exits

1. **Entrance**
   - Exits: South to Antechamber
   - Purpose: The starting point of the dungeon. It sets the foreboding tone with damp walls and the echo of distant water drops.

2. **Antechamber**
   - Exits: North to Entrance, West to Guardroom, East to Crossroads
   - Purpose: A transitional room that introduces players to the layout of the dungeon. Flickering torchlight provides a sense of direction, with exits leading to different branches.

3. **Guardroom**
   - Exits: East to Antechamber
   - Purpose: A defensive checkpoint, filled with skeletal remains and rusted weapons. This room offers a hint of the dangers that lie ahead, building tension for explorers. 

4. **Crossroads**
   - Exits: West to Antechamber, South to Treasure Room
   - Purpose: The central decision-making point of the dungeon. It features ancient murals and hints at hidden secrets, encouraging players to choose their path wisely.

5. **Armory**
   - Exits: North to Antechamber
   - Purpose: A storage area for weapons and armor, partially flooded and overgrown with moss. Offers players a chance to find useful items or clues.

6. **Treasure Room**
   - Exits: North to Crossroads
   - Purpose: The ultimate destination, heavily trapped and guarded by a lingering spectral sentinel. Contains valuable loot and a mysterious artifact to reward diligent adventurers.

### Design Notes

- **Flow**: The dungeon is designed with a central Antechamber that allows players to choose between a more dangerous path (Guardroom -> Armory) or a more rewarding path (Crossroads -> Treasure Room).
- **Exploration vs. Convenience**: The Crossroads offers a shortcut to the Treasure Room for those daring enough to face potential traps directly, while the detour through the Guardroom and Armory allows for more strategic preparation.
- **Discovery**: The Guardroom contains hints of hidden paths and secrets, encouraging players to look for more than just the straightforward route.
- **Pacing**: The layout provides a gradual build-up of tension and reward, with the climax in the Treasure Room.
- **Realism**: The layout makes sense as a defensive structure, with the Guardroom positioned to protect the treasure and the Armory providing resources.
- **Vertical Space**: Though not explicitly used here, the damp, mossy environment of the Armory suggests the potential for hidden lower levels or flooded passages.
