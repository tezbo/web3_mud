### Design Notes

- **Flow and Exploration**: The dungeon is designed with a central hub (Forsaken Hall) that provides multiple paths, encouraging exploration. The hidden and secret passages create a sense of mystery and reward players who pay attention to their surroundings.

- **Vertical Space**: The use of stairs in the Forsaken Hall to the Silted Cellar adds a vertical element, enhancing the sense of descending into a deeper, more dangerous area.

- **Natural Storytelling**: Each room's name and description hint at the history and nature of the dungeon, inviting players to piece together the story as they explore.

- **Balance**: The layout balances exploration with convenience, offering shortcuts and hidden paths to reward curiosity and provide a sense of discovery.

This Shadowfen Dungeon District offers a layered experience with both clear objectives and hidden depths, encouraging players to engage with the space thoughtfully.
