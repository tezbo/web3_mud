**Design Notes on Flow and Purpose:**

- **Flow:** The Main Hall acts as the central hub, allowing players to branch out to different parts of the dungeon. This encourages strategic planning and revisiting areas as needed.
- **Purpose:** Each room serves a specific function, creating a narrative of the dungeon's past use and current state. The Entry sets the scene, while the Armory and Cells reveal more about the dungeon's history.
- **Exploration:** The layout encourages exploration through the promise of useful items in the Armory and potential secrets in the Cells. The Torture Chamber provides atmospheric storytelling and tension.
- **Realism:** The layout reflects a functional dungeon, with logical placement of rooms. The Entry is the only way in and out, while the Main Hall's central position allows for efficient movement.
- **Discovery and Pacing:** The dungeon rewards players who explore the less obvious paths (e.g., Cells) with valuable items or lore. The clustered nature ensures related rooms are accessed without excessive backtracking.

The design aims to balance player exploration with logical space use, providing a concise yet rich dungeon experience.
