### Room List with Exits
1. **Entrance Hall**
   - Exits: East to Torture Chamber (2)
   - Notes: The starting point of the dungeon, dimly lit with flickering torches. Sets the foreboding tone for the rest of the dungeon.

2. **Torture Chamber**
   - Exits: West to Entrance Hall (1), East to Reliquary (3), South to Guard Post (4)
   - Notes: Filled with ominous tools and remnants of past interrogations. Acts as a central hub within the dungeon, giving players multiple paths to explore.

3. **Reliquary**
   - Exits: West to Torture Chamber (2)
   - Notes: A room cluttered with ancient artifacts and relics. A hidden compartment rewards players with a unique item if they search thoroughly.

4. **Guard Post**
   - Exits: North to Torture Chamber (2), South to Prison Cells (5)
   - Notes: Once manned by vigilant guards, now deserted. Contains clues to the history of the dungeon and hints about the treasure in the Reliquary.

5. **Prison Cells**
   - Exits: North to Guard Post (4), South to Hidden Passage (6)
   - Notes: Rows of decrepit cells, some still locked. A keen observer might notice one cell has loose bars, concealing a hidden passage.

6. **Hidden Passage**
   - Exits: North to Prison Cells (5)
   - Notes: A narrow, secretive path leading to a hidden stash of treasure and a potential shortcut back to the surface, rewarding those who explore thoroughly.

### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose
- **Flow**: The dungeon's flow encourages exploration by providing multiple routes from the central Torture Chamber. Players must decide whether to seek treasure in the Reliquary or delve deeper through the Guard Post.
- **Purpose**: Each room has a distinct thematic purpose, contributing to the storyline of an abandoned, haunted dungeon. The Torture Chamber acts as a central hub, while the Guard Post and Prison Cells reveal the dungeon's dark past.
- **Discovery**: The Hidden Passage offers a rewarding discovery for those players who pay attention to environmental clues in the Prison Cells.
- **Realism**: The layout reflects a logical progression from entrance to the heart of the dungeon, with realistic room functions like guarding, imprisonment, and relic storage.
- **Vertical Space**: Although primarily horizontal, the dungeon hints at verticality through the potential to find a shortcut back to the surface via the Hidden Passage, adding a layer of complexity to exploration.

This design provides an engaging blend of exploration, storytelling, and logical structure suitable for a Shadowfen-style dungeon.
