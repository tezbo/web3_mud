### Room List with Exits and Design Notes

1. **Entrance Hall**
   - Exits: Up to Main Corridor
   - Notes: The starting point for adventurers, featuring ominous carvings and a foreboding atmosphere. It sets the tone for the rest of the dungeon with dim lighting and echoing footsteps.

2. **Main Corridor**
   - Exits: Down to Entrance Hall, Left to Guard Room, Up to Hidden Chamber
   - Notes: A long hallway that serves as the main artery of the dungeon. It encourages players to choose their path, either confronting guards or searching for secrets.

3. **Guard Room**
   - Exits: Right to Main Corridor
   - Notes: A heavily fortified room where dungeon guards are stationed. Provides a combat challenge and rewards strategizing. Players may find keys or clues here.

4. **Hidden Chamber**
   - Exits: Down to Main Corridor, Right to Secret Tunnel, Up to Treasure Vault
   - Notes: A cleverly concealed room that can be discovered through exploration or solving puzzles. This room provides lore and hints about the dungeon's backstory, enhancing the narrative depth.

5. **Secret Tunnel**
   - Exits: Left to Hidden Chamber
   - Notes: A narrow and winding passageway that offers a shortcut back to the entrance or a stealthy route past the guards. Encourages exploration and rewards players with an alternative path.

6. **Treasure Vault**
   - Exits: Down to Hidden Chamber
   - Notes: The ultimate reward room, filled with treasures and rare items. It requires solving puzzles or defeating a mini-boss found in the Hidden Chamber to gain access.

### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Flow**: The dungeon is designed to guide players through a central path (Main Corridor) while offering choices for exploration (Hidden Chamber, Secret Tunnel). This ensures a balance between linear progression and player agency.

- **Purpose**: Each room serves a distinct thematic and gameplay purpose. The Entrance Hall sets the atmosphere, the Guard Room provides combat, the Hidden Chamber offers lore, and the Treasure Vault rewards exploration.

- **Discovery**: Hidden Chamber and Secret Tunnel serve as optional areas that reward curious players with shortcuts or additional narrative elements.

- **Realism**: The logical placement of rooms (e.g., guards near the entrance, treasure hidden deep within) enhances the believability of the dungeon's layout.

- **Vertical Space**: Utilizes up/down exits to create a sense of depth and exploration, encouraging players to think vertically as well as horizontally.

This map balances exploration and storytelling while maintaining a logical and engaging dungeon crawl experience.
