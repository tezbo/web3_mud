### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Central Hub (Main Chamber):** Serves as the main connection point, ensuring players naturally pass through it multiple times.
- **Exploration (Side Passage and Hidden Lair):** Encourages players to explore off the beaten path for extra rewards, enhancing the sense of discovery.
- **Pacing:** The layout balances linear progression (Guard Post to Treasure Vault) with optional exploration (Side Passage and Hidden Lair).
- **Realism:** The layout mimics a fortified underground space, with layers of security and secretive areas fitting the Shadowfen theme.
- **Vertical Space:** The use of vertical movement (up/down) creates a sense of depth and layers within the dungeon, enhancing the exploratory experience.
