### Design Notes

- **Flow and Central Hub:** The Main Hall acts as the central hub, allowing easy access to key locations such as the Armory and the Cell Block. This keeps players oriented while encouraging exploration beyond the main path.

- **Exploration and Discovery:** The Torture Chamber serves as a critical point for discovery, revealing the hidden Secret Vault below. This layered complexity rewards players who are curious and thorough in their exploration.

- **Purpose and Realism:** Each room has a clear, logical purpose. The Guard Room secures the entrance, the Main Hall connects major areas, the Armory provides resources, the Cell Block holds prisoners, the Torture Chamber adds depth to the narrative, and the Secret Vault offers a treasure-laden reward for diligent adventurers.

- **Vertical Space:** The use of vertical space with the Secret Vault adds a dimension to exploration, creating a sense of depth and mystery, fitting the Shadowfen style's dark and secretive theme.
