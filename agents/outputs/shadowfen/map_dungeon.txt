Here's the design for a 6-room district called 'Dungeon' in Shadowfen style:

```
          [5] Guard Post
            /   \
          /       \
[1] Entrance - [2] Main Hall - [3] Torture Chamber
          |       |
          |       |
        [6] Prison Cells
            |
        [4] Secret Passage
```

**Room List with Exits:**

1. **Entrance**
   - Exits: East to Main Hall, South to Secret Passage
   - Purpose: The entry point of the dungeon; a narrow, damp corridor with flickering torchlight. Sets the stage for the oppressive atmosphere.

2. **Main Hall**
   - Exits: West to Entrance, East to Torture Chamber, South to Prison Cells
   - Purpose: Central hub of the dungeon; a large, echoing chamber with a high ceiling. It serves as the intersection for major paths, allowing flow to key areas.

3. **Torture Chamber**
   - Exits: West to Main Hall
   - Purpose: A grim room filled with sinister devices. Acts as a dead-end for those who explore, reinforcing the dungeon's dark theme and rewarding players with narrative elements and loot.

4. **Secret Passage**
   - Exits: North to Entrance
   - Purpose: A hidden, narrow corridor that provides a shortcut back to the Entrance. This passage rewards observant players with a quicker route and potential hidden treasures.

5. **Guard Post**
   - Exits: South to Main Hall, East to Prison Cells
   - Purpose: A small room overlooking the Main Hall, used by guards to monitor movement. Adds vertical complexity as it might be on a slightly raised platform.

6. **Prison Cells**
   - Exits: North to Main Hall, West to Guard Post
   - Purpose: A row of iron-barred cells for prisoners. Players might find useful items or story elements here, enhancing the exploration aspect.

**Design Notes:**

- **Flow and Navigation:** The Main Hall acts as the central hub, ensuring players can easily navigate to key areas without getting lost. The placement of the Guard Post and Torture Chamber emphasizes the oppressive nature of the dungeon.

- **Exploration and Discovery:** The Secret Passage provides an element of surprise and rewards players who pay attention to their surroundings. The Prison Cells offer narrative depth, potentially tied to quests or character stories.

- **Realism and Atmosphere:** The spatial design reinforces the theme of a foreboding dungeon. Each room has a logical purpose and contributes to the overall mood of decay and danger.

- **Layered Complexity:** The Guard Post and Secret Passage utilize vertical and hidden elements to enrich player experience, adding depth and encouraging thorough exploration.

### Shadowfen Dungeon Map

  [Entrance]
     |
  [Antechamber]
     |
[Guardroom] -- [Storeroom]
     |
  [Main Hall]
     |
 [Hidden Alcove]
```

### Room List with Exits:

1. **Entrance**
   - Exits: South to Antechamber
   - Purpose: Serves as the entry point to the dungeon. It's a narrow, damp passage that sets the mood for the rest of the dungeon.

2. **Antechamber**
   - Exits: North to Entrance, South to Guardroom
   - Purpose: A small room that acts as a buffer between the outside and the more secured parts of the dungeon. It contains remnants of old banners and broken furniture.

3. **Guardroom**
   - Exits: North to Antechamber, East to Storeroom, South to Main Hall
   - Purpose: Once housing the dungeon guards, this room has remnants of old weaponry and armor. Provides a natural intersection for players to decide their next path.

4. **Storeroom**
   - Exits: West to Guardroom
   - Purpose: Contains crates and barrels with some useful supplies and a few minor treasures. Encourages players to explore side areas for rewards.

5. **Main Hall**
   - Exits: North to Guardroom, South to Hidden Alcove
   - Purpose: The largest room in the dungeon, used as a central area for gatherings or rituals. Decorated with ancient symbols and partially collapsed stone pillars.

6. **Hidden Alcove**
   - Exits: North to Main Hall
   - Purpose: A secretive area partially hidden behind a loose stone wall in the Main Hall. Contains a modest treasure or key item for deeper lore, rewarding keen explorers.

### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose:

- **Flow and Exploration**: The dungeon layout encourages exploration through a central path (Guardroom to Main Hall) with offshoots (Storeroom and Hidden Alcove) that reward curiosity. The storeroom is easily accessible, providing a small reward early on, while the Hidden Alcove requires players to pay attention to environmental cues for discovery.

- **Central Hub**: The Guardroom serves as the central hub, with multiple exits allowing players to make meaningful choices about their progression.

- **Pacing**: The design clusters the main path from the Entrance to the Main Hall, with the Hidden Alcove providing a final, optional area for players who engage with the space more thoroughly.

- **Realism and Storytelling**: The logical flow from Entrance to Main Hall mirrors a realistic progression into the depths of the dungeon, with each room serving a believable purpose within the context of a fortified space.

- **Vertical Spaces**: Not utilized in this design, as the focus is on a horizontal exploration experience typical of a ground-level dungeon.

This layout provides a balanced mix of exploration, discovery, and logical progression, capturing the essence of a Shadowfen-style dungeon.
