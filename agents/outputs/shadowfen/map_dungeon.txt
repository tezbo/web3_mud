### Room List with Exits

1. **Entrance**
   - Exits: East to Main Hall
   - Purpose: Entry point to the dungeon. A narrow, dimly lit passage that sets the eerie tone.

2. **Main Hall**
   - Exits: West to Entrance, East to Prison Cells, South to Alchemist's Lair, North to Secret Room
   - Purpose: Central hub of the dungeon. A large, damp chamber with high ceilings, serving as a crossroads for exploration.

3. **Prison Cells**
   - Exits: West to Main Hall
   - Purpose: A row of decrepit cells. Chains and old bones hint at past captives. Key for Secret Room might be hidden here.

4. **Alchemist's Lair**
   - Exits: North to Main Hall
   - Purpose: A cluttered workspace with potions and strange artifacts. Contains clues to access the Secret Room.

5. **Secret Room**
   - Exits: South to Main Hall, North to Treasure Vault
   - Purpose: Hidden chamber accessed by solving a puzzle or finding a key. Contains lore and a powerful artifact.

6. **Treasure Vault**

   - Purpose: Final reward for exploration. Lavishly decorated with chests of gold and rare items. Must be unlocked via Secret Room.

### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The Entrance leads players directly into the Main Hall, the central hub, allowing them to choose their path of exploration. The Main Hall connects all other rooms, ensuring players return here as they explore deeper.
  
- **Exploration vs. Convenience:** While the Main Hall offers easy access to multiple rooms, secrets encourage thorough exploration. The Secret Room and Treasure Vault reward players for delving into less obvious areas.
  
- **Storytelling:** Each room provides clues about the dungeon's history and inhabitants. The Prison Cells hint at a darker past, while the Alchemist's Lair suggests ongoing experiments.
  
- **Realism:** The layout simulates a functional dungeon with a central area for operations (Main Hall) and specialized rooms for different purposes (Prison Cells, Alchemist's Lair).
  
- **Vertical Space:** Though all rooms are on the same level, the Secret Room acts as a vertical challenge by requiring players to 'descend' into deeper knowledge and skill to unlock the Treasure Vault.
