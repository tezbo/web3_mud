- **Flow:** Rooms are connected logically, with the Great Hall serving as a natural navigation point to other areas.
- **Discovery:** The Hidden Vault is a secret area, accessed through exploration of the Guard Quarters, rewarding players with treasure.
- **Pacing:** The dungeon is designed to gradually reveal its secrets, guiding players from the Entrance to the deepest sections.
- **Realism:** The layout follows a logical structure, with living quarters, an armory, and a chapel suggesting a once-functional dungeon.
- **Vertical Space:** While this dungeon doesn't use vertical space due to its small size, the idea of a hidden vault provides depth and intrigue.

This design encourages players to explore and rewards them with secrets and treasures, maintaining an engaging and mysterious atmosphere.
