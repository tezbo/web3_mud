### Room List with Exits

1. **Entrance**
   - **Exits:** South to Guard Post
   - **Purpose:** The initial point of entry into the dungeon, setting the tone with damp, moss-covered walls. This is where players first encounter the ominous atmosphere of the Shadowfen style.

2. **Guard Post**
   - **Exits:** North to Entrance, East to Torture Chamber, South to Main Hall
   - **Purpose:** A checkpoint and possible encounter point with enemies. This area is essential for controlling access deeper into the dungeon and adds a layer of intimidation.

3. **Torture Chamber**
   - **Exits:** West to Guard Post
   - **Purpose:** A grim reminder of the dungeon's purpose, this room contains various instruments of agony. It serves as a storytelling element, highlighting the dark history of the dungeon.

4. **Main Hall**
   - **Exits:** North to Guard Post, South to Prison Cells
   - **Purpose:** The central hub of the dungeon, providing access to key areas. The Main Hall is a large, echoing chamber with eerie lighting, emphasizing the scale and depth of the dungeon.

5. **Prison Cells**
   - **Exits:** North to Main Hall, South to Hidden Passage
   - **Purpose:** Rows of barred cells containing skeletons or restless spirits. This area is pivotal for quests related to rescuing prisoners or retrieving lost items.

6. **Hidden Passage**
   - **Exits:** North to Prison Cells, East to Treasure Room
   - **Purpose:** A cleverly concealed path that rewards exploration. Players who investigate closely will find this secret route leading to a hidden cache.

7. **Treasure Room**
   - **Exits:** West to Hidden Passage
   - **Purpose:** A small, well-guarded room containing valuable loot. This area is the ultimate reward for players who uncover the hidden passage, offering rare items and treasures.

### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose:** The dungeon is designed to mimic the oppressive atmosphere typical of Shadowfen, with a logical progression from the Entrance to the Treasure Room. Each room serves a purpose in storytelling and gameplay, from the foreboding Guard Post to the rewarding Treasure Room.

- **Exploration vs. Convenience:** While the main path is straightforward, the Hidden Passage offers an incentive for keen explorers. This adds a layer of complexity and encourages players to investigate their surroundings.

- **Realism and Storytelling:** The layout makes physical sense, with the Guard Post logically placed to protect the Main Hall, and the Prison Cells leading to a secretive area. The Torture Chamber, while optional, adds depth to the dungeon's narrative.

- **Layered Complexity:** Vertical spaces are not utilized in this design as the focus remains on horizontal exploration, with the hidden path providing sufficient complexity for a six-room district.
