### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose:** The dungeon is designed with a guarded central hub (Guard Post) that players must navigate around. The flow encourages exploration, with the primary challenge being the guards and the potential discovery of secret passages.
- **Exploration vs. Convenience:** The Hidden Passage offers an exploration reward, creating a shortcut and alternative route to the Treasure Chamber.
- **Natural Storytelling:** The layout tells the story of a functioning prison dungeon, with areas logically placed to suggest their function (e.g., Prison Cells near Guard Post, Treasure Chamber hidden away).
- **Vertical Space:** Utilizes vertical transitions in the Guard Post to add depth (Hidden Passage, Treasure Chamber).
- **Realism:** The layout is designed to make sense structurally for a dungeon, with the Guard Post as the central control point, and side areas serving distinct purposes.
