### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Flow:** The Grand Chamber acts as a central hub, allowing players to choose between exploring the Prison Cells for lore, the Alchemist's Lair for crafting resources, or seeking out the Hidden Crypt for secrets. The path to the Treasure Vault encourages progression and a sense of achievement.
  
- **Exploration and Discovery:** The map encourages exploration through the Hidden Crypt, which rewards players for finding and solving the secret passage in the Alchemist's Lair. The use of vertical space in the Alchemist's Lair adds depth and a sense of discovery.

- **Storytelling through Space:** Each room tells a part of the dungeon's backstory, from the haunted memories in the Prison Cells to the arcane secrets of the Alchemist's Lair. The Treasure Vault serves as the culmination of the player's journey, providing context to the dungeon's existence.

- **Pacing and Realism:** The layout avoids linear progression and instead offers branching paths that make logical sense for a dungeon setting. The use of a central hub and thematic clustering of rooms supports natural exploration while maintaining a coherent narrative.

This design balances the need for logical navigation with opportunities for discovery, creating an engaging and immersive dungeon experience in the Shadowfen style.
