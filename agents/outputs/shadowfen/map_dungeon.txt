### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose**: The dungeon is designed to guide players from the Entrance Hall and allow them to choose between the Guard Post and Prison Cells, creating a non-linear exploration experience. The Guard Post serves as a secondary hub, branching into the Torture Chamber and Armory, enhancing strategic planning and decision-making.
  
- **Discovery and Exploration**: The Hidden Treasury is a key element, rewarding players who thoroughly explore the Armory. The presence of environmental storytelling in the Torture Chamber and Prison Cells enriches the narrative and adds depth to the dungeon's backstory.

- **Pacing and Realism**: The layout balances exploration with purpose, situating rooms logically (e.g., the Armory near the Guard Post and Prison Cells). The progression from entrance to treasure room builds anticipation and satisfaction.

- **Vertical Space**: Although this map is flat, it suggests natural verticality through environmental descriptions (e.g., stairwells in the Entrance Hall leading to uncharted levels or visual elements hinting at deeper layers). This alludes to further exploration opportunities in expanded maps or future updates.
