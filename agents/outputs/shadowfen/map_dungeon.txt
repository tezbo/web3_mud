### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose**: The Dungeon is designed with a logical flow, starting at the Entrance and moving through the Guard Room, which serves as a central hub. From the Guard Room, players can access the Storage Chamber for additional exploration or proceed deeper into the Dungeon via the Main Hall.
  
- **Exploration and Discovery**: The Storage Chamber provides an opportunity for discovery and finding hidden items or lore. The Guard Room's connection to multiple paths encourages players to explore and determine their preferred route.

- **Pacing and Realism**: The layout balances exploration with convenience. The Guard Room serves as a checkpoint, making it realistic for a Dungeon's defensive structure. The Treasure Vault's position requires players to engage with the Dungeon's main path, creating a sense of accomplishment when reached.

- **Vertical and Layered Complexity**: While this design does not use vertical space, it emphasizes branching pathways, encouraging players to consider their choices and explore methodically.

- **Storytelling Through Space**: Each room's purpose contributes to the overall narrative of the Dungeon, with the Guard Room controlling access, the Main Hall directing flow, and the Treasure Vault providing an ultimate goal, all tied into the Shadowfen's mysterious and guarded style.
