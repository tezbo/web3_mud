Certainly! Here's a 6-room district called 'Dungeon' in the Shadowfen style:

```
       [Guard Post]
           |
   [Torture Chamber] -- [Storage Room]
           |
       [Prison Cells] -- [Secret Passage]
           |
       [Warden's Office]
```

### Room List with Exits:

1. **Guard Post**
   - Exits: South to Torture Chamber
   - Purpose: Entry point with vigilant guards, sets the tone and guards the path deeper into the dungeon.

2. **Torture Chamber**
   - Exits: North to Guard Post, South to Prison Cells, East to Storage Room
   - Purpose: Central hub within the dungeon, where prisoners are broken. High traffic area with multiple exits.

3. **Storage Room**
   - Exits: West to Torture Chamber
   - Purpose: Holds torture devices and supplies, a small room off the main path. Could hide a key or item for exploration rewards.

4. **Prison Cells**
   - Exits: North to Torture Chamber, East to Secret Passage
   - Purpose: Rows of cells where prisoners are kept. Contains a hidden switch leading to the Secret Passage, rewarding players who explore.

5. **Secret Passage**
   - Exits: West to Prison Cells
   - Purpose: A hidden path that might lead to an escape route or treasure. Adds layered complexity and encourages exploration.

6. **Warden's Office**
   - Exits: North to Prison Cells
   - Purpose: The office of the dungeon's overseer. Contains important documents or clues for lore and quest progression.

### Design Notes:

- **Flow**: The dungeon's flow is designed to lead players from the entry Guard Post down into the more sinister areas, with the Torture Chamber serving as a central hub. 
- **Purpose**: Each room has a clear role, enhancing the narrative of a grim and oppressive place. 
- **Exploration**: The Secret Passage offers a hidden discovery element, rewarding players who thoroughly explore their environment.
- **Pacing**: The layout encourages players to traverse through different layers of the dungeon, from the functional Guard Post to the depths of the Prison Cells, enhancing the feeling of descent into a shadowy underworld.
- **Realism**: The layout makes sense for a dungeon, with logical placements of rooms based on their functions and the need for security and concealment.
