### Room List with Exits

1. **Entrance Hall**
   - Exits: South to Guard Room
   - Purpose: The main entry point into the dungeon, sets the tone with damp stone walls and flickering torchlight. A large iron door leads southward.

2. **Guard Room**
   - Exits: North to Entrance Hall, East to Treasure Vault, West to Prison Cells
   - Purpose: Central hub of the dungeon. Guards once kept watch here; now, it's eerily quiet. Players can choose which path to explore next.

3. **Prison Cells**
   - Exits: East to Guard Room, South to Torture Chamber
   - Purpose: Rows of rusty barred cells, some still occupied by long-dead prisoners. Clues about the dungeon's history can be found here.

4. **Treasure Vault**
   - Exits: West to Guard Room, South to Torture Chamber
   - Purpose: A hidden trove, mostly plundered but with a few valuable items left. Traps guard the remaining treasures.

5. **Torture Chamber**
   - Exits: North to Prison Cells, North to Treasure Vault, South to Secret Passage
   - Purpose: A grim room filled with sinister implements. Provides narrative depth about past atrocities. A hidden lever opens the way south.

6. **Secret Passage**
   - Exits: North to Torture Chamber
   - Purpose: A narrow, concealed corridor leading out of the dungeon. Offers an escape route or a surprise entry for players who discover it.

### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Central Hub (Guard Room):** Acts as the dungeon's main junction, aligning with the principle of high-traffic areas having multiple exits. Players can choose their exploration path, enhancing agency and engagement.

- **Flow:** The Guard Room's connections ensure players naturally discover key areas (Prison Cells and Treasure Vault) while maintaining a sense of mystery and suspense.

- **Discovery:** The Secret Passage rewards players who pay attention to environmental storytelling in the Torture Chamber, providing a shortcut or potential escape.

- **Pacing:** The layout ensures players must navigate through more rooms to reach the Secret Passage, spreading out discovery and encouraging thorough exploration.

- **Realism:** The dungeon's layout makes physical sense, with logical room placements reflecting their functions (e.g., Treasure Vault not directly accessible from the entrance).

- **Vertical Space:** While primarily horizontal, the hidden nature of the Secret Passage introduces a layered complexity, suggesting vertical movement and hidden depths without explicit vertical design.
