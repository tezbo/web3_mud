### Design Notes

- **Flow:** Players start at the Entrance and naturally progress upward through the Chamber as a central hub, encouraging exploration of optional paths like the Guardroom and Treasure.
- **Exploration vs. Convenience:** The Chamber offers multiple paths, giving players choices and rewarding exploration. Hidden Treasure room encourages thorough investigation.
- **Storytelling:** The layout reflects an ancient burial site, with the Tomb and Crypt providing narrative depth through environmental storytelling.
- **Realism:** The vertical progression from Entrance to Crypt mimics descending deeper into an underground tomb.
- **Vertical Space:** Utilizes vertical space effectively with an upward progression, creating a sense of descending into the depths of an ancient crypt by moving upwards through the map’s structure.
