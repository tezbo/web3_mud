### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose:** The dungeon is designed with a central hub (Guard Post) that connects to each of the rooms, creating a sense of exploration and danger without feeling linear. The layout encourages players to strategize their movement, especially when seeking the Treasure Vault.
  
- **Exploration and Discovery:** The Arcane Chamber acts as a pivotal point for accessing both the Vault and the Library, offering players choices and rewarding curiosity. The Dark Library hints at lore and potential hidden pathways.

- **Realism and Atmosphere:** Each room serves a logical purpose within the context of a dark, mysterious dungeon. The thematic consistency of shadow and secrecy aligns with the Shadowfen style, enhancing the player's immersive experience.

- **Vertical Complexity:** Though this map uses a flat structure, the potential for vertical exploration is suggested through the Arcane Chamber's mystical elements, hinting at magical lifts or hidden trapdoors.

The dungeon balances exploration and storytelling, inviting players to engage with its mystery and danger.
