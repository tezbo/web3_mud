### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Central Hub:** The Abandoned Crypt acts as the main hub, connecting to four other rooms, encouraging players to explore and discover new paths.
- **Flow:** The layout ensures players naturally transition from the central hub to other areas. Hidden passages add a layer of complexity and reward curiosity.
- **Discovery:** Hidden passages in the Treasure Chamber and Catacombs reward players who explore thoroughly. The discovery of these paths gives a sense of accomplishment.
- **Pacing:** Rooms are clustered to ensure a sense of progression. The transition from the crypt to the sewers offers a change in environment and pacing.
- **Realism:** The design reflects a plausible underground layout, with logical connections between a crypt, catacombs, and prison cells, all tied together by the central crypt.
- **Vertical Space:** Utilizes vertical elements with a trapdoor in the Abandoned Crypt leading down to the Sewer Entrance, adding depth and a sense of exploration.

This Shadowfen Dungeon District offers players a rich environment to explore, filled with secrets and storytelling potential through its spatial design.
