## Room List and Exits

1. **[A] Entry Hall**
   - **Exits:** East to [B], South to [D]
   - **Notes:** The starting point for adventurers, this room sets the tone with dimly lit torches and damp stone walls. It funnels players towards either exploration (to [B]) or combat (to [D]).

2. **[B] Fallen Library**
   - **Exits:** West to [A], East to [C]
   - **Notes:** A once-grand library now in ruins, filled with collapsed shelves and scattered books. Here, players can find lore that hints at the dungeon's history and secrets. It's a hub that connects deeper into the dungeon.

3. **[C] Ritual Chamber**
   - **Exits:** West to [B], South to [E]
   - **Notes:** The heart of the Shadowfen Dungeon, where dark rituals were once performed. This room holds the main quest objective and a hidden passage (requires investigation) to [E].

4. **[D] Guard Barracks**
   - **Exits:** North to [A], South to [F]
   - **Notes:** Housing for the dungeon's defenders, now overrun by creatures. Offers combat encounters and a chance for players to collect weapons or armor.

5. **[E] Secret Treasury**
   - **Exits:** North to [C]
   - **Notes:** A hidden room revealed by solving a puzzle in the Ritual Chamber [C]. Contains valuable loot and artifacts, rewarding players for their curiosity and problem-solving.

6. **[F] Prison Cells**
   - **Exits:** North to [D]
   - **Notes:** A grim area with metal bars and chains. Players may find clues to the dungeon's past prisoners or even rescue someone who can provide aid or information.

## Design Notes

- **Flow:** The Entry Hall [A] gives a choice of initial direction, allowing players to decide their approach—either through lore and exploration via the Library [B] or more direct combat via the Barracks [D].
  
- **Central Hub:** The Fallen Library [B] serves as a central hub, directing players towards the Ritual Chamber [C] and hinting at the dungeon's history.

- **Discovery and Secrets:** The Ritual Chamber [C] contains a hidden passage to the Secret Treasury [E], encouraging players to investigate their surroundings thoroughly.

- **Pacing and Realism:** The placement of rooms reflects logical use of space—guards near the entrance in [D], prisoners isolated in [F], and ritual activities centralized in [C].

- **Vertical Space:** Although this map does not utilize vertical space, the inclusion of a hidden passage in [C] to [E] adds a layer of complexity akin to finding a secret stairway or passage.

This design balances exploration with combat, providing multiple paths and rewarding players who venture off the beaten path.
