### Design Notes

- **Flow**: The Main Hall acts as a central hub, allowing access to different parts of the dungeon, encouraging exploration of both side rooms and hidden areas.
  
- **Discovery**: The Treasury is hidden, requiring players to solve a puzzle or find a secret passage in the Main Hall.

- **Pacing**: The layout encourages players to explore each area for resources or clues, with the crypt setting the tone and the armory providing necessary equipment.

- **Realism**: The dungeon layout makes sense with a central hall leading to important rooms, and the vertical elements (Basement and Guard Tower) adding depth and complexity.

- **Vertical Space**: The Main Hall's connections up to the Guard Tower and down to the Basement add layers to exploration, offering different challenges and perspectives.
