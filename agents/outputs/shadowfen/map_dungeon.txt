Certainly! Here's the design for a 6-room district called 'Dungeon' in the Shadowfen style. This design embodies an ominous, swampy environment with an emphasis on exploration and hidden paths.

```
     [Entrance]
        |
  [Guard Post] -- [Prison Cells]
        |              |
   [Torture Room]  [Secret Passage]
        |              |
    [Chamber of Rites] - [Treasure Vault]
```

### Room List:

   - **Exits**: South to Guard Post
   - **Purpose**: The initial entry point into the dungeon. Dimly lit and overgrown with moss, setting a foreboding tone.

2. **Guard Post**

   - **Purpose**: A central hub for the dungeon guards. Players may encounter NPCs here. Provides a strategic location with multiple exits to explore.

3. **Prison Cells**
   - **Exits**: West to Guard Post, South to Secret Passage

4. **Torture Room**
   - **Exits**: North to Guard Post, South to Chamber of Rites
   - **Purpose**: An unsettling room with various instruments. Contains clues or items related to dungeon lore. Serves as a transition to deeper areas.

5. **Secret Passage**

   - **Purpose**: A hidden path discovered through exploration. Provides a shortcut to valuable locations, rewarding curious players.

6. **Chamber of Rites**
   - **Exits**: North to Torture Room, East to Treasure Vault
   - **Purpose**: A ceremonial chamber used for dark rituals. Offers a narrative climax with potential encounters or puzzles.

7. **Treasure Vault**
   - **Exits**: West to Secret Passage, West to Chamber of Rites
   - **Purpose**: The final reward area containing valuable loot. Accessed through exploration and solving puzzles.

### Design Notes:

- **Flow**: The Guard Post serves as a central hub, offering multiple paths to allow players to choose their progression. The initial linear path from Entrance to Guard Post ensures players get a sense of the dungeon's atmosphere before branching out.
  
- **Exploration**: The Secret Passage rewards players who explore the Prison Cells thoroughly. This hidden path adds depth and a sense of discovery.

- **Purpose and Storytelling**: Each room is designed to add to the dungeon's ominous narrative. From the foreboding Entrance to the dark rituals in the Chamber of Rites, players uncover the dungeon's history as they progress.

- **Vertical Space**: The layout remains on a single plane, which suits the swampy Shadowfen style, emphasizing horizontal exploration and hidden paths over vertical complexity.
