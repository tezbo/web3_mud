Design Notes on Flow and Purpose:
- **Central Hub:** The Guard Room acts as the central hub, connecting most critical rooms and providing a strategic point for players to regroup and plan further exploration.
- **Flow:** Players naturally progress from the Entrance Hall to the Guard Room, where they can choose to explore the Armory or the Prison. This choice allows for different playstyles and strategies.
- **Discovery:** The Hidden Vault offers a reward for players who thoroughly explore the Torture Chamber. This hidden area encourages attentiveness and curiosity.
- **Pacing:** By clustering the Prison and Torture Chamber, the narrative of the dungeon as a place of confinement and suffering is reinforced. The Armory offers a contrasting utilitarian function.
- **Realism:** The layout makes logical sense for a dungeon used to detain and interrogate prisoners while maintaining security through the Guard Room.
- **Vertical Space:** Although not explicitly used in this map, the potential for vertical exploration (e.g., hidden ladders or trapdoors) can be incorporated in future expansions or additional layers.
