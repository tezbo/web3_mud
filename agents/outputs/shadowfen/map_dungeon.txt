### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose**: The dungeon begins at the Entrance, guiding players into the Foyer, which acts as a central hub. From here, players can choose to explore the historical Gallery or venture into the foreboding Chamber. The Treasure room serves as a reward for those who explore the less obvious paths, while the Sanctum represents the narrative climax, offering the toughest challenges.

- **Discovery and Exploration**: The hidden path to the Treasure room from the Gallery rewards players seeking lore and loot. The design encourages thorough exploration with its non-linear connections.

- **Pacing and Realism**: The layout reflects a believable structure; the progression from Entrance to Sanctum mirrors a journey deeper into danger. The Foyer's central position allows for strategic navigation, while the Gallery and Chamber provide thematic variety.

- **Atmosphere and Storytelling**: The dungeon's design leverages Shadowfen's swampy, decaying aesthetic, using environmental storytelling (like the waterlogged Foyer and decaying Chamber) to enhance immersion and narrative depth.
