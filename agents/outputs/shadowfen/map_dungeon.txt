### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose**: The dungeon is designed with a logical progression from preparation (Armory) to resting and information gathering (Barracks), moving into exploration and conflict (Guard Post, Main Hall), and culminating in high-stakes discovery (Torture Chamber, Secret Vault).

- **Exploration and Discovery**: The hidden switch in the Torture Chamber creates a rewarding shortcut to the Secret Vault. The layout encourages players to explore thoroughly to find valuable rewards.

- **Realism and Storytelling**: The layout reflects a plausible military structure, with the Armory and Barracks placed strategically for defense, a Guard Post for vigilance, and a Main Hall as the dungeon's nerve center.

- **Pacing**: Rooms are clustered in a way that allows for quick transitions between combat and exploration, with the Main Hall serving as a central regrouping point.

- **Central Hub**: The Main Hall acts as a central hub, facilitating easy navigation to most parts of the dungeon while maintaining a sense of scale and distance.

- **Vertical Space**: While this design is primarily horizontal, vertical elements like hidden passages or staircases could be added to enhance complexity.
