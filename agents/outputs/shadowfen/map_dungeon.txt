### Design Notes

- **Flow and Exploration:** The layout encourages players to explore and discover hidden elements, such as the secret passage between [B] and [E]. The path from [A] to [F] provides a straightforward progression, while the lateral rooms offer additional rewards for those who deviate from the main path.
  
- **Natural Storytelling:** Each room serves a purpose that contributes to the overall narrative of a forgotten, swamp-infested dungeon. The transition from the Entrance Hall to the Dark Altar Room tells a story of descent into deeper and darker parts of the dungeon.

- **Pacing and Realism:** The arrangement of rooms reflects a realistic and immersive environment, with the armory and treasury logically placed away from the entrance but accessible through exploration.

- **Vertical and Horizontal Complexity:** Though primarily horizontal, the map employs horizontal complexity through secret passages and obstacles, enhancing the sense of mystery and danger typical of Shadowfen style.

This design balances exploration and storytelling, encouraging players to delve into each room's unique features while maintaining a coherent and immersive dungeon experience.
