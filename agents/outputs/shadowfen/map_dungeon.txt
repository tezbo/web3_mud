**Room List with Exits:**

1. **[Entrance Hall]**

   - Notes: The gateway to the Dungeon, featuring imposing stone doors. This area serves as the first step into the depths, setting the tone with dim lighting and eerie echoes.

2. **[Main Corridor]**
   - Exits: South to Entrance Hall, North to Torture Chamber, East to Storage Room
   - Notes: A central artery for the Dungeon, this corridor is lined with flickering torches. It connects the entrance to deeper parts of the Dungeon, encouraging further exploration.

3. **[Storage Room]**
   - Exits: West to Main Corridor
   - Notes: A side chamber filled with dusty crates and forgotten supplies. Players might find useful items or clues here, rewarding those who stray from the main path.

4. **[Torture Chamber]**
   - Exits: South to Main Corridor, North to Hidden Alcove
   - Notes: A grim room used for interrogation, complete with ominous implements and shackles. It adds to the Dungeon's dark atmosphere and serves as a thematic centerpiece.

5. **[Hidden Alcove]**
   - Exits: South to Torture Chamber, East to Secret Exit, North to Treasure Chamber
   - Notes: A concealed area that players must discover, possibly through interacting with objects or solving a puzzle. It connects to both a hidden exit and a treasure room, rewarding inquisitive adventurers.

6. **[Treasure Chamber]**
   - Exits: South to Hidden Alcove
   - Notes: The ultimate reward for those who explore thoroughly, this chamber contains valuable loot. Its hidden nature encourages players to search for clues and secrets throughout the Dungeon.

**Design Notes:**

- **Flow and Purpose:** The Dungeon is designed with a main path from the Entrance Hall to the Treasure Chamber, with a side detour to the Storage Room. The Hidden Alcove acts as a branching point for resourceful players to find additional exits and treasures.
- **Exploration and Discovery:** Hidden passages and rooms like the Hidden Alcove and Secret Exit reward players who explore beyond the obvious route.
- **Thematic Consistency:** The layout and room functions, such as the Torture Chamber and Treasure Chamber, reinforce the dark and foreboding atmosphere typical of a Shadowfen Dungeon.
- **Logical Layout:** The organization of rooms makes sense spatially, with functional connections like the Storage Room being a logical offshoot of the Main Corridor and the Treasure Chamber being well-guarded by its hidden location.
