### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The linear path from Entrance to Dark Shrine ensures players experience key narrative elements, while side rooms (Prison Cells and Armory) provide opportunities for exploration and reward.
- **Exploration vs. Convenience:** Main Hall serves as the central hub to facilitate movement, while Prison Cells and Armory offer optional paths for players who wish to explore further.
- **Realism:** The layout reflects an organized albeit sinister underground facility, with logical progression from entry, through security, and into the heart of darkness.
- **Vertical Space:** The design is flat, as suits the underground setting, with hidden passages adding vertical complexity.
- **Storytelling:** Each room contributes to the narrative of a once-operational facility turned into a place of malevolent rituals, enhancing the sense of mystery and danger.
