### Design Notes

- **Flow and Exploration**: The dungeon is designed to naturally guide players from the Entrance to the Treasure Vault. The central Main Hall acts as a hub, encouraging exploration of side rooms (Guard Barracks and Armory) before reaching the ultimate goal.
  
- **Discovery and Complexity**: Hidden passages or secret levers could be integrated into the Guard Barracks or Armory to unlock additional treasures or lore. This rewards thorough exploration.

- **Pacing and Realism**: The layout respects the need for logical room placement, with the Guard Barracks strategically positioned near the entrance for defense, and the Armory accessible for quick armament.

- **Atmosphere and Storytelling**: Each room contributes to the dungeon's narrative, from the eerie silence of the Antechamber to the opulent but guarded Treasure Vault, enhancing immersion and player engagement.
