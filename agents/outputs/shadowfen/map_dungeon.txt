### Room List with Exits

1. **Chamber of Echoes**
   - Exits: Down to Hidden Tunnel
   - Purpose: Entry point. The acoustics here create disorienting echoes, setting an eerie tone. Serves as the main entrance to the Dungeon.

2. **Hidden Tunnel**
   - Exits: Up to Chamber of Echoes, Right to Treasure Vault, Down to Mossy Corridor
   - Purpose: A narrow, dimly-lit passage that holds an optional path to a secret treasure. It's a reward for players who choose to explore.

3. **Treasure Vault**
   - Exits: Left to Hidden Tunnel
   - Purpose: A hidden room containing valuable loot. Only accessible by those who explore the Hidden Tunnel. It encourages players to take risks and explore side paths.

4. **Mossy Corridor**
   - Exits: Up to Hidden Tunnel, Down to Guard Post
   - Purpose: A transition area showing signs of age and neglect, lined with flickering torches and damp moss. Acts as a main artery leading deeper into the Dungeon.

5. **Guard Post**
   - Exits: Up to Mossy Corridor, Right to Prison Cell
   - Purpose: A checkpoint for players, possibly inhabited by enemy guards. It reinforces the Dungeon's defensive nature and offers a strategic chokepoint.

6. **Prison Cell**
   - Exits: Left to Guard Post
   - Purpose: A grim room filled with the remains of past captives. Provides narrative depth and might contain clues or items related to quests.

### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The Dungeon is designed to lead players naturally from the entrance through to the Guard Post, with opportunities for exploration along the way. The main path is straightforward, but the Hidden Tunnel offers a detour for treasure seekers.
  
- **Exploration vs. Convenience:** The Hidden Tunnel and Treasure Vault present optional exploration opportunities without detracting from the main storyline. Players can choose to delve deeper or proceed directly.
  
- **Storytelling:** The rooms tell a story of a once-defensive structure now overgrown and partly forgotten. The Chamber of Echoes sets an atmospheric tone, while the Guard Post and Prison Cell hint at its past use.

- **Realism:** The layout makes physical sense, with defensive structures (Guard Post) placed appropriately to protect key areas (Treasure Vault).

- **Vertical Space:** Limited use of vertical space to maintain simplicity, with the main vertical transition being between the Chamber of Echoes and the Mossy Corridor via the Hidden Tunnel.
