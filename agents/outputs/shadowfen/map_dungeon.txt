### Room List with Exits

1. **Chamber of Echoes**
   - Exits: South to Ancient Hallway
   - Notes: A large, echoing chamber with intricate carvings on the walls. Acts as the main entry point into the dungeon, setting an eerie atmosphere for what's to come.

2. **Ancient Hallway**
   - Exits: North to Chamber of Echoes, East to Forgotten Armory, South to Mossy Crypt
   - Notes: A long corridor lined with faded murals. Central hub of the dungeon, providing access to other key areas. Encourages exploration with multiple pathways.

3. **Forgotten Armory**
   - Exits: West to Ancient Hallway
   - Notes: A room filled with rusted weapons and armor. Hidden treasures can be found here, rewarding those who stray from the main path.

4. **Mossy Crypt**
   - Exits: North to Ancient Hallway, East to Secret Alcove, South to Sunken Cellar
   - Notes: Damp and overgrown with moss, this crypt houses several ancient sarcophagi. Serves as a transition zone, leading deeper into the dungeon.

5. **Secret Alcove**
   - Exits: West to Mossy Crypt
   - Notes: A small, hidden area accessible through the mossy crypt. Contains valuable loot for keen explorers. Symbolizes the reward for thorough exploration.

6. **Sunken Cellar**
   - Exits: North to Mossy Crypt
   - Notes: The lowest point in the dungeon, partially flooded. Challenges players with environmental hazards but offers shortcuts back to the surface for those who navigate it well.

### Design Notes

- **Flow**: The Ancient Hallway serves as the central hub, naturally guiding players to explore each area. The layout encourages players to venture off the main path (e.g., to the Forgotten Armory and Secret Alcove) for rewards.
- **Discovery**: Hidden treasures and environmental storytelling (like faded murals and ancient sarcophagi) enrich the experience and provide narrative depth.
- **Pacing**: The progression from the Chamber of Echoes down to the Sunken Cellar creates a sense of descending deeper into the dungeon's mysteries.
- **Realism**: The layout ensures a logical organization, with the crypt and cellar located below ground level, enhancing immersion.
- **Vertical Space**: The Sunken Cellar introduces vertical complexity, offering a different spatial dynamic with its partial flooding and potential shortcuts.
