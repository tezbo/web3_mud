   - Exits: West to Entrance, East to Tomb of the Forgotten, South to Crypt Overlook

#### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose**: The dungeon flows from the Entrance, splitting towards the Guard Room and Dripping Hall, encouraging exploration. The Guard Room acts as a central hub to access the Tomb of the Forgotten and Crypt Overlook, rewarding players who fully explore with strategic advantages and lore. The Flooded Vault serves as the final challenge, offering rewards for thorough exploration.

- **Exploration vs. Convenience**: The layout encourages exploration with branching paths from the Guard Room and the allure of hidden secrets in the Tomb of the Forgotten. The Crypt Overlook provides a shortcut view, enticing players to plan their approach.

- **Natural Storytelling**: Each room tells a part of the crypt's history, from the forgotten guards to the ceremonial tombs, and the natural decay of the Dripping Hall and Flooded Vault.

- **Realism**: The layout reflects a logical progression deeper into the crypt, with water levels increasing as players move southward, suggesting natural flood patterns over time.

- **Layered Complexity**: Vertical elements are implied with the Crypt Overlook, adding depth to exploration and tactical planning, while hidden switches and submerged treasures offer additional layers of engagement.
