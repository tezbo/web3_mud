### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The Central Chamber serves as the primary hub, ensuring players naturally pass through it to reach significant areas like the Treasure Vault or the Prison Cells. This design encourages exploration while maintaining a clear route.
  
- **Discovery:** The Secret Tunnel rewards players who explore the Prison Cells thoroughly, offering a shortcut and a sense of mystery. The Treasure Vault is a clear goal, enticing players with the promise of reward.

- **Pacing:** The layout encourages players to progress from the mundane (Guard Post) to the mysterious (Secret Tunnel), providing a gradual build-up in atmosphere and narrative depth.

- **Realism:** The design reflects a defensive structure with logical placements—guards first, main activities central, and valuables hidden away. The Prison Cells are placed to suggest their secondary importance to the structure's original purpose.

- **Shadowfen Style:** The dungeon reflects the eerie and mysterious nature of Shadowfen, with rooms that tell a story of past use and abandonment, enhanced by atmospheric descriptions and subtle narrative clues.
