Certainly! Below is the design for a 6-room district called 'Dungeon' in the Shadowfen style. This design includes a main path with hidden side passages and a central hub for exploration.

### Room List and Exits:

1. **Forgotten Hallway (Entrance)**
   - Exits: South to Echoing Cavern
   - Notes: The entry point to the dungeon, a narrow passage with faint markings on the walls. Sets the tone for the Shadowfen style with an eerie atmosphere.

2. **Echoing Cavern (Main Path)**
   - Exits: North to Forgotten Hallway, East to Abandoned Armory, South to Whispering Crypt
   - Notes: A large, resonant chamber where players need to decide their path. Central hub for exploration.

3. **Abandoned Armory (Loot and Weapons)**
   - Exits: West to Echoing Cavern
   - Notes: A treasure trove of forgotten weapons and armor. A reward room for those who explore off the main path.

4. **Whispering Crypt (Hidden Passage)**
   - Exits: North to Echoing Cavern, East to Hidden Alcove
   - Notes: An eerie room with faint whispers echoing throughout. Hidden passage leads to a secret area.

5. **Shadow Chamber (Treasure Room)**
   - Exits: South to Whispering Crypt
   - Notes: A heavily guarded room with lore-rich artifacts. The ultimate reward for those who navigate through the dungeon.

6. **Hidden Alcove (Optional Area)**
   - Exits: West to Whispering Crypt
   - Notes: A secluded space with rare items and lore details. Rewards those who seek out secrets.

### Design Notes:

- **Flow and Purpose**: The dungeon is designed with a central hub (Echoing Cavern) that branches out to other important areas. Players must choose their path strategically, balancing risk and reward.

- **Exploration**: The hidden passage (Whispering Crypt) and the optional area (Hidden Alcove) encourage players to explore beyond the obvious routes, rewarding them with unique items and lore.

- **Pacing**: The layout clusters related rooms, creating a natural progression from entry to treasure. The Shadow Chamber is an end goal, providing a satisfying climax to the exploration.

- **Realism**: The physical layout makes sense as a dungeon with interconnected spaces and strategically placed rooms for storage, defense, and secrets.

- **Vertical Space**: While this design is horizontal, vertical elements (such as staircases or ladders) could be added in specific rooms for additional complexity, like a tower in the Shadow Chamber or a pit in the Whispering Crypt.
