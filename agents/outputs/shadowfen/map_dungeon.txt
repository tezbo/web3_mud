### Room List and Exits

1. **Entrance**
   - **Exits:** North to Guard Barracks
   - **Purpose:** The starting point for players entering the dungeon. It's a foreboding entry with rusted iron gates and dim torches. Sets the tone for the rest of the dungeon.

2. **Guard Barracks**
   - **Exits:** North to Torture Chamber, South to Entrance
   - **Purpose:** The resting area for dungeon guards. Contains bunks and weapon racks. Players may find minor loot or clues about the dungeon's operation.

3. **Torture Chamber**
   - **Exits:** North to Dark Passage, East to Holding Cells, South to Guard Barracks
   - **Purpose:** A grim room filled with cruel implements. This is a central hub where players can choose to explore deeper into the dungeon or investigate the cells.

4. **Holding Cells**
   - **Exits:** West to Torture Chamber
   - **Purpose:** A series of barred cells where prisoners are kept. Offers potential side quests or lore about captives and their stories. Exploration may lead to hidden items or keys.

5. **Dark Passage**
   - **Exits:** North to Sacrificial Chamber, South to Torture Chamber
   - **Purpose:** A shadowy corridor that connects the central Torture Chamber to the deeper, more sinister areas of the dungeon. It's a narrow space with secret alcoves and potential ambushes.

6. **Sacrificial Chamber**
   - **Exits:** South to Dark Passage
   - **Purpose:** The final, ominous room where dark rituals are conducted. Features an altar and atmospheric lighting. Key plot points or bosses could be located here.

### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The map is designed to guide players through a logical progression from the Entrance to the Sacrificial Chamber while offering optional exploration in the Holding Cells. The Torture Chamber acts as a central hub.
- **Purpose:** Each room has a distinct purpose, enhancing the narrative of a dark and forbidding dungeon. The progression becomes increasingly eerie, culminating in the Sacrificial Chamber.
- **Discovery:** The Holding Cells offer optional content that rewards players with additional lore and items. Players who explore these areas deepen their understanding of the dungeon's backstory.
- **Realism:** The layout maintains a sense of realism with logical room placements, such as the Guard Barracks near the entrance and the Holding Cells adjacent to the Torture Chamber.
- **Vertical Space:** Although primarily horizontal, the narrow Dark Passage introduces a sense of depth and complexity, suggesting hidden or layered spaces within the dungeon.

This layout balances exploration with a clear progression, encouraging players to delve deeper into the dark mysteries of the 'Dungeon' district.
