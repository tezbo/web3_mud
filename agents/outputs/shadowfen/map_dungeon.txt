### Design Notes

- **Flow and Exploration**: The design uses a hub-and-spoke layout centered around the [Central Chamber], encouraging players to explore each branch. The map encourages returning to the center to progress.
  
- **Convenience vs. Exploration**: The main path proceeds linearly from [Entrance Hall] to [Central Chamber] but offers side paths for exploration (e.g., [Storage], [Prison], [Alchemy Lab]).

- **Room Purpose and Storytelling**: Each room has a clear purpose, contributing to the narrative of the dungeon's operational structure and its inhabitants' lives.

- **Natural Storytelling**: The progression from entry, through security ([Guard Post]), and into the heart of operations ([Central Chamber]) tells a story of a well-guarded, functional facility.

- **Realism and Aesthetics**: The layout logically represents a defensive and operational dungeon. The presence of function-specific rooms adds to the realism of the space being used and maintained by its occupants.
