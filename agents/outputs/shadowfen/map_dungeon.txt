### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Flow**: The dungeon is designed with a logical progression from the entrance to the deeper, more secure areas. The Guard Post serves as a central hub, allowing easy oversight of key areas.
  
- **Purpose**: Each room has a distinct function, reflecting a realistic prison environment. The Guard Post and Armory ensure the dungeon is well-defended, while the Prison Cells and Interrogation Room highlight the enforcement aspect.

- **Discovery**: Hidden elements, such as the escape tunnel in the Armory and the trapdoor in the Interrogation Room, add depth and reward exploration. These features encourage players to search for alternative paths and secrets.

- **Pacing**: The rooms are clustered logically to maintain thematic cohesion, with the most critical areas (Prison Cells, Interrogation Room) located deeper in the district to emphasize security.

- **Realism**: The layout reflects practical considerations for a dungeon, ensuring that movement through the space feels natural and purposeful. The vertical separation is hinted at through hidden passages rather than explicit staircases, maintaining an air of mystery.
