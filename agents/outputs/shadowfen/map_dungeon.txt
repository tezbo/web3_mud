### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The Main Chamber acts as the central hub, with clear paths leading to other essential rooms. It encourages exploration with hints towards the Hidden Passage.
- **Exploration:** The Hidden Passage is a reward for curious players, providing a shortcut or additional loot. The layout promotes investigation of each room's purpose.
- **Realism:** The Guard Room's proximity to the Armory makes logical sense, as does the secret passage leading to an important Altar Room.
- **Vertical Space:** Utilizes verticality with the Hidden Passage leading up to the Altar Room, adding dimension and mystery to the exploration.
- **Storytelling:** Each room offers lore pieces, such as the Hall of Echoes' whispers or the Altar Room's sacred artifacts, gradually revealing the dungeon's history.
