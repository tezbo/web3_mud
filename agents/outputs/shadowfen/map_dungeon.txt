Design Notes on Flow and Purpose:

- **Central Hub**: The Main Path acts as the central corridor, ensuring players pass through it to access most areas, maintaining flow and centrality.
- **Exploration and Discovery**: The Hidden Cave offers an optional path with the reward of reaching the Treasure Vault, encouraging curiosity and keen observation.
- **Logical Placement**: The Guard Post is logically placed near the entrance (Main Path) to oversee dungeon activities, while the Altar Room is set apart to preserve its sanctity.
- **Pacing**: The Main Path's bifurcation into the Guard Post and Hidden Cave ensures exploration is spread out, offering players a chance to choose their path.
- **Realism**: The layout reflects a believable dungeon, with a clear purpose for each room, enhancing the storytelling through spatial design.
