3. **Main Chamber**
   - Exits: North to Armory, East to Hidden Alcove, South to Prison Cells

### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose**: The dungeon features a linear progression with a key central hub (Main Chamber) encouraging exploration and discovery. The Hidden Alcove provides an optional path for players who enjoy searching for secrets.
- **Exploration and Convenience**: While the main path is straightforward, the secret room adds an additional layer of depth. The Treasure Vault at the end offers a satisfying payoff for exploring the entire dungeon.
- **Natural Storytelling**: Each room tells a part of the dungeon's story: the Entrance Hall sets the atmosphere, the Armory hints at its past defenders, the Main Chamber serves as a strategic hub, the Prison Cells reveal its darker aspects, and the Treasure Vault offers a rewarding climax.
- **Vertical Space**: While this design primarily uses horizontal space, vertical elements like the high ceiling in the Main Chamber and the damp, sunken nature of the Prison Cells add depth.
- **Realism**: The layout reflects a logical progression from entry to treasure, with rooms serving distinct purposes that make sense within the context of a Shadowfen-style dungeon.
