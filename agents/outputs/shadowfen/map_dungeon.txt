Here's a design for a 6-room district called 'Dungeon' in the Shadowfen style:

```
       [Treasure Chamber]
             |
          (secret)
             |
       [Lair of the Beast]
             |
             |
       [Flooded Passage]
        /          \
[Entrance] -- [Collapsed Chamber]
        \          /
      [Guardroom]
```

### Room List with Exits:

1. **Entrance**
   - Exits: North to Flooded Passage, East to Collapsed Chamber, South to Guardroom
   - Notes: The main entry point into the dungeon. It's intentionally placed to encourage players to explore different paths leading deeper into the dungeon.

2. **Flooded Passage**
   - Exits: South to Entrance, North to Lair of the Beast
   - Notes: A narrow, waterlogged corridor that slows movement, increasing tension. Acts as a bottleneck leading to the central chambers.

3. **Lair of the Beast**
   - Exits: South to Flooded Passage, North (secret) to Treasure Chamber
   - Notes: A larger room, home to a formidable creature. The secret exit to the Treasure Chamber is well-hidden, rewarding players who thoroughly investigate this area.

4. **Treasure Chamber**
   - Exits: South (secret) to Lair of the Beast
   - Notes: The reward for players' exploration efforts, filled with valuable loot. Accessible only through the secret path from the Lair of the Beast.

5. **Collapsed Chamber**
   - Exits: West to Entrance, South to Guardroom
   - Notes: A partially caved-in room, offering environmental storytelling about the dungeon's instability. Provides a shortcut back to the Guardroom.

6. **Guardroom**
   - Exits: North to Entrance, East to Collapsed Chamber
   - Notes: Once manned, now abandoned. Contains clues about the dungeon's history and potential threats. Serves as a hub for players to plan their next move.

### Design Notes:

- **Flow and Exploration**: The main path runs from the Entrance through the Flooded Passage to the Lair of the Beast. Players are encouraged to explore side rooms like the Collapsed Chamber and Guardroom, which provide background lore and alternative routes.

- **Central Hub**: The Entrance acts as a central hub with multiple exits, allowing for varied exploration paths.

- **Discovery and Reward**: The secret path to the Treasure Chamber is a reward for players who engage in thorough exploration, accessible only through the Lair of the Beast.

- **Realism and Storytelling**: The Flooded Passage and Collapsed Chamber create a sense of neglect and danger, fitting the Shadowfen theme of a forgotten, treacherous place.

- **Vertical Space**: While not explicitly vertical, the use of hidden paths and narrow passages creates a sense of layered complexity and depth.
