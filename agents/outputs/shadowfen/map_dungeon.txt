- **Discovery:** The Secret Passage rewards players who explore thoroughly, offering an optional route that can lead to hidden treasures or exits.
- **Realism:** The layout mimics practical medieval dungeons, with security at the forefront and layered challenges as players move deeper.
- **Vertical Space:** Although this map doesn't explicitly use vertical space, future expansions could include staircases or trapdoors leading to other dungeon levels.

This design creates a mysterious and engaging dungeon experience, inviting players to uncover its secrets while navigating its treacherous corridors.
