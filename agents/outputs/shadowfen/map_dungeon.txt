### Room List and Exits

1. **Altar Room**
   - **Exits:** South to Ritual Hall
   - **Notes:** The heart of the dungeon, where forbidden rites are performed. A place of dark power, echoing with the chants of long-gone cultists.

2. **Ritual Hall**
   - **Exits:** North to Altar Room, East to Hall of Echoes, West to Armory
   - **Notes:** A large chamber used for gatherings and rituals. The central hub of the dungeon, connecting major areas and facilitating easy navigation.

3. **Hall of Echoes**
   - **Exits:** North to Ritual Hall, East to Armory, South to Cellar
   - **Notes:** An eerie corridor where whispers and footsteps seem to linger. This hallway creates a loop, fostering exploration and discovery of hidden passages.

4. **Armory**
   - **Exits:** North to Ritual Hall, West to Hall of Echoes
   - **Notes:** A repository for weapons and armor, now mostly looted. The presence of forgotten gear hints at the dungeon's former military significance.

### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The Ritual Hall serves as the central hub, allowing players to easily navigate between key areas. It connects directly to the Altar Room, ensuring that the main quest path is clear.

- **Exploration:** The Hall of Echoes forms a loop with the Armory, encouraging players to explore and discover the Cellar, a hidden area with potential rewards.

- **Realism:** Each room has a logical placement, reflecting a coherent use of space. The Altar Room is secluded, as befits its ceremonial purpose, while the Armory is accessible for defense.

- **Storytelling:** The layout tells a story of a once-thriving cult, now in ruins. The placement of rooms suggests a hierarchy and purpose, with the Altar at the spiritual center.

- **Vertical Space:** The dungeon is primarily on one level, with the Cellar providing vertical exploration. This preserves the sense of descent often associated with dungeons.
