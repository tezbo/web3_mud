- **Purpose and Storytelling**: Each room serves a logical purpose within a dungeon setting, enhancing the narrative. The Research Lab hints at the dark activities taking place, while the Prison Cells provide subplots.

- **Exploration and Discovery**: The Hidden Passage offers a side quest feeling, rewarding players with a Treasure Chamber. This encourages thorough exploration and rewards curiosity.

- **Realism**: The layout mimics a believable dungeon, with the Guard Room positioned to oversee the Prison Cells and the Main Hall serving as a connective space for ease of access.

- **Vertical Space**: While not explicitly detailed, the Hidden Passage could include a ladder or trap door leading to an upper or lower level, adding verticality and depth.

This design balances exploration and storytelling, encouraging players to delve deeper into the Shadowfen dungeon to uncover secrets and rewards.
