### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose**: The map design encourages players to navigate through the Main Chamber, which serves as the central hub, ensuring they encounter multiple paths and decisions. The design also guides players naturally from the Entrance to key areas like the Cells and Guard Chamber, while the Hidden Passage and Treasure Room offer an optional, rewarding exploration path.
  
- **Exploration and Discovery**: The Hidden Passage and the down exit from the Cells room encourage players to explore and discover secrets, providing optional challenges and rewards.
  
- **Pacing and Realism**: The dungeon's layout is compact but non-linear, providing a sense of depth and complexity without overwhelming the player. The spatial logic is consistent with a dungeon setting, emphasizing security (Guard Chamber) and mystery (Hidden Passage).

- **Vertical Space**: Although the map is primarily horizontal, the Entrance and Cells incorporate vertical elements, enhancing the dungeon's dimensionality and realism.
