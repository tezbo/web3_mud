### Room List with Exits

1. **Entry Hall**
   - Exits: North to Chamber of Echoes, East to Guard Post
   - Purpose: The primary entry point into the dungeon, where players first arrive. It's a wide room with damp stone walls and a heavy, iron-bound door leading further into the depths.

2. **Guard Post**
   - Exits: West to Entry Hall
   - Purpose: A small, fortified room where dungeon guards would traditionally be stationed. Now abandoned, it contains old weapon racks and a few scattered bones, hinting at its history. Offers a quick glimpse into the dungeon’s use as a defensive structure.

3. **Chamber of Echoes**
   - Exits: South to Entry Hall, North to Secret Passage
   - Purpose: A large, cavernous room where any sound is amplified and distorted. The room's acoustics are used to disorient intruders. It serves as a central hub within the dungeon, allowing access to deeper, more dangerous areas.

4. **Secret Passage**
   - Exits: South to Chamber of Echoes, North to Treasure Vault, East to Hidden Chamber
   - Purpose: A narrow, hidden corridor that rewards players' curiosity and exploration. Its discovery is key for accessing the Treasure Vault and an optional side room, the Hidden Chamber.

5. **Hidden Chamber**
   - Exits: West to Secret Passage
   - Purpose: A small, secluded room off the Secret Passage. Contains lore-rich artifacts and clues about the dungeon's past, offering narrative depth and rewarding players who explore beyond the main path.

6. **Treasure Vault**
   - Exits: South to Secret Passage
   - Purpose: The ultimate reward room, filled with valuable loot and guarded by a puzzle or trap mechanism. Represents the culmination of the dungeon's exploration and is accessed only by those who find the Secret Passage.

### Design Notes

- **Flow**: The Entry Hall naturally directs players towards the Chamber of Echoes, which functions as a central hub for this small dungeon. From there, players can discover the Secret Passage that branches out to the Treasure Vault and Hidden Chamber.
  
- **Exploration vs. Convenience**: While the main path is straightforward, the Secret Passage encourages exploration, rewarding players with access to valuable resources and story elements.
  
- **Storytelling through Space**: Each room has been designed to convey the dungeon's history—an abandoned guard post, a disorienting echo chamber, and a hidden treasure vault—offering narrative layers to discover.
  
- **Realism and Verticality**: The layout remains horizontal, appropriate for the Shadowfen style, focusing on hidden and narrow passages rather than vertical complexity, fitting the marshy, dense nature of the environment.
