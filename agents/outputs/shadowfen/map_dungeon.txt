### Room List with Exits

1. **Entrance**
   - **Exits:** South to Antechamber
   - **Purpose:** The initial point of entry into the dungeon, setting a foreboding tone. It's narrow and dimly lit, designed to give the player a sense of caution.

2. **Antechamber**
   - **Exits:** North to Entrance, South to Main Hall, East to Armory
   - **Purpose:** Acts as a buffer zone between the outside world and the deeper parts of the dungeon. It serves as a resting point where adventurers can prepare for the challenges ahead.

3. **Armory**
   - **Exits:** West to Antechamber
   - **Purpose:** Provides players with essential supplies and equipment. It's a small room filled with ancient weapons and armor, rewarding those who take the time to explore.

4. **Main Hall**
   - **Exits:** North to Antechamber, East to Hidden Alcove, South to Chamber of Secrets
   - **Purpose:** The central hub of the dungeon where most paths converge. It's a large, echoing chamber that hints at the dungeon's history through carvings and ruins.

5. **Hidden Alcove**
   - **Exits:** West to Main Hall
   - **Purpose:** A secret room tucked away behind a concealed passage. It rewards players with treasure or lore for those who explore thoroughly. It's a quiet, secluded space that feels untouched.

6. **Chamber of Secrets**
   - **Exits:** North to Main Hall
   - **Purpose:** The deepest part of the dungeon, holding the significant lore or the main objective of the area. It's designed to be the climactic point of exploration, featuring complex puzzles or a powerful adversary.

### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Flow:** The layout encourages players to move through the dungeon in a logical progression. The Main Hall acts as the central hub, making it a natural point for players to reconvene after exploring side rooms like the Armory and Hidden Alcove.
  
- **Exploration vs. Convenience:** While the Armory and Hidden Alcove provide side explorations, their contents justify the detour. The Hidden Alcove, in particular, is a reward for perceptive players who notice its concealed entrance.

- **Storytelling:** Each room contributes to the narrative of a once-great fortress now succumbing to shadow and decay. The progression from Entrance to Chamber of Secrets mirrors a descent into the heart of mystery.

- **Realism:** The dungeon's structure is reminiscent of ancient strongholds, with a strategic armory near the entrance, a central hall for gathering, and hidden areas for secrets and treasures.

- **Vertical Space:** While this particular design is on a single plane, multi-level complexity could be introduced by adding staircases in the Antechamber leading to upper or lower sections for further expansion.
