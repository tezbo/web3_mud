### Room List with Exits

- **[A] Entrance Chamber**
  - **Exits:** South to [C], East to [B]
  - **Purpose:** Starting point for adventurers entering the dungeon. Dimly lit with moss-covered stone walls. A place to set the tone for the exploration.

- **[B] Guardroom**
  - **Exits:** West to [A], South to [D]
  - **Purpose:** Once manned by guards, now abandoned. Contains old weapons and a hidden side passage to a small treasure cache (not shown on the map).

- **[C] Central Hall**
  - **Exits:** North to [A], South to [E], East to [D]
  - **Purpose:** The main hub of the dungeon, a large room with multiple pathways leading out. Its openness encourages exploration in different directions. 

- **[D] Armory**
  - **Exits:** West to [C], North to [B]
  - **Purpose:** Contains old, rusted weapons and armor. Offers clues about the dungeon's past. A hidden trapdoor here leads down to a secondary, unexplored lower level (not shown).

- **[E] Ritual Chamber**
  - **Exits:** North to [C], East to [F]
  - **Purpose:** A dark, foreboding room with an altar at its center. Offers lore and hints about the dungeon's origins. A sense of mystery surrounds this room.

- **[F] Storage Room**
  - **Exits:** West to [E]
  - **Purpose:** Filled with old crates and barrels. Some might still contain useful supplies. Offers the potential for hidden rewards for those who take the time to search.

### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The central hall [C] serves as the primary hub, allowing players to choose between multiple paths (north to the entrance, south to the ritual chamber, east to the armory). This creates a natural flow and encourages exploration.
  
- **Discovery:** The guardroom [B] and the armory [D] both contain secret elements (a hidden side passage and a trapdoor, respectively) that reward players who search carefully.

- **Pacing:** The entrance chamber [A] and central hall [C] are relatively straightforward, allowing players to get their bearings before moving into more complex areas like the ritual chamber [E] and hidden sections.

- **Realism:** Each room has a clear purpose, reflecting a functioning dungeon environment. The layout is compact but offers sufficient complexity to feel like a realistic, lived-in space.

- **Vertical Space:** The trapdoor in the armory [D] suggests deeper layers to explore, adding vertical complexity and future exploration opportunities without overwhelming the initial district design.
