### Room List with Exits and Design Notes

1. **Entrance Hall**
   - Exits: Up to Main Corridor
   - Notes: The starting point for adventurers, featuring ominous carvings and a foreboding atmosphere. It sets the tone for the rest of the dungeon with dim lighting and echoing footsteps.

2. **Main Corridor**
   - Exits: Down to Entrance Hall, Left to Guard Room, Up to Hidden Chamber
   - Notes: A long hallway that serves as the main artery of the dungeon. It encourages players to choose their path, either confronting guards or searching for secrets.

3. **Guard Room**
   - Exits: Right to Main Corridor
   - Notes: A heavily fortified room where dungeon guards are stationed. Provides a combat challenge and rewards strategizing. Players may find keys or clues here.

4. **Hidden Chamber**
   - Exits: Down to Main Corridor, Right to Secret Tunnel, Up to Treasure Vault
   - Notes: A cleverly concealed room that can be discovered through exploration or solving puzzles. This room provides lore and hints about the dungeon's backstory, enhancing the narrative depth.

5. **Secret Tunnel**
   - Exits: Left to Hidden Chamber
   - Notes: A narrow and winding passageway that offers a shortcut back to the entrance or a stealthy route past the guards. Encourages exploration and rewards players with an alternative path.

6. **Treasure Vault**
   - Exits: Down to Hidden Chamber
   - Notes: The ultimate reward room, filled with treasures and rare items. It requires solving puzzles or defeating a mini-boss found in the Hidden Chamber to gain access.

### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Flow**: The dungeon is designed to guide players through a central path (Main Corridor) while offering choices for exploration (Hidden Chamber, Secret Tunnel). This ensures a balance between linear progression and player agency.

- **Purpose**: Each room serves a distinct thematic and gameplay purpose. The Entrance Hall sets the atmosphere, the Guard Room provides combat, the Hidden Chamber offers lore, and the Treasure Vault rewards exploration.

- **Discovery**: Hidden Chamber and Secret Tunnel serve as optional areas that reward curious players with shortcuts or additional narrative elements.

- **Realism**: The logical placement of rooms (e.g., guards near the entrance, treasure hidden deep within) enhances the believability of the dungeon's layout.

- **Vertical Space**: Utilizes up/down exits to create a sense of depth and exploration, encouraging players to think vertically as well as horizontally.

This map balances exploration and storytelling while maintaining a logical and engaging dungeon crawl experience.

           |  Prison  |
           |  Cells   |
           |  (S)     |
           +----+-----+
```

**Room List with Exits:**

1. **Crypt (Tomb)**
   - Exits: South to Catacomb
   - Notes: The starting point of the dungeon, filled with ancient tombs. This room sets the eerie atmosphere and introduces players to the Shadowfen style.

2. **Catacomb (Storage)**
   - Exits: North to Crypt, South to Crossroads
   - Notes: A narrow corridor lined with sarcophagi. Serves as a transition space from the Crypt, increasing tension as players delve deeper.

3. **Crossroads**
   - Exits: North to Catacomb, East to Torture Chamber, West to Guard Room, South to Prison Cells
   - Notes: The central hub of the dungeon, allowing players to choose different paths. Encourages exploration and decision-making.

4. **Guard Room (Barracks)**
   - Exits: East to Crossroads
   - Notes: A room with remnants of old guard equipment. Offers insight into the dungeon's historical use and may contain some minor loot.

5. **Torture Chamber**
   - Exits: North to Crossroads
   - Notes: A disturbing room with rusty torture devices. Adds to the dark storytelling and might hold a hidden side passage or treasure for those who search carefully.

6. **Prison Cells**
   - Exits: North to Crossroads
   - Notes: The deepest part of the dungeon, featuring iron bars and cells. Potentially houses a quest NPC or an important item.

**Design Notes on Flow and Purpose:**

- **Central Hub (Crossroads):** Designed to be the central point where players make strategic decisions on which path to explore, ensuring they experience the dungeon's breadth.
- **Flow:** Players naturally progress from the Crypt to the Crossroads, choosing their path while maintaining a sense of exploration.
- **Discovery:** The Torture Chamber may have a hidden passage to reward those who investigate thoroughly.
- **Pacing:** The Guard Room and Prison Cells are offset to provide a sense of distance and discovery, while the central Crossroads keeps movement logical and interconnected.
- **Realism:** The layout mirrors a plausible underground dungeon with practical transitions between rooms.
- **Storytelling:** Each room contributes to the overall theme of a long-abandoned, once-secure fortress now in decay, hinting at its dark past.

This design balances exploration with narrative depth, offering players a rich experience in the Shadowfen style.
