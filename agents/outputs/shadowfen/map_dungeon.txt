### Room List with Exits

1. **Entrance**
   - Exits: South to Guard Room
   - Notes: The entrance is a foreboding stone archway overgrown with creeping vines. It's designed to set the mood for the dungeon. The path leads directly to the Guard Room, introducing a sense of guarded secrecy.

2. **Guard Room**
   - Exits: North to Entrance, South to Main Hall, East to Treasure Vault
   - Notes: This room is where players first encounter resistance. The presence of guards here suggests that something valuable is nearby. The Treasure Vault is accessible but well-protected.

3. **Treasure Vault**
   - Exits: West to Guard Room
   - Notes: A heavily fortified room with ancient chests and artifacts. Optional for players who are willing to fight through the Guard Room. The layout encourages risk-reward decision-making.

4. **Main Hall**
   - Exits: North to Guard Room, South to Hidden Chamber, East to Ancient Library
   - Notes: A large, open space with crumbling columns and faded murals. This is the central hub where players can choose to delve deeper or explore sideways. It connects to both the lore-rich Ancient Library and the mysterious Hidden Chamber.

5. **Ancient Library**
   - Exits: West to Main Hall
   - Notes: Filled with dusty tomes and scrolls, this room offers story and lore about the Shadowfen Dungeon. It's a reward for players interested in the narrative and may contain clues about hidden paths or shortcuts.

6. **Hidden Chamber**
   - Exits: North to Main Hall
   - Notes: A secretive room accessible through a cleverly concealed door in the Main Hall. It contains powerful relics or keys needed for future quests, rewarding players for thorough exploration.

### Design Notes

- **Flow**: The dungeon is structured with a clear flow from the Entrance to the Guard Room, encouraging players to confront challenges before accessing rewards. The Main Hall serves as a central hub, allowing players to choose their path and discover different room types.
  
- **Purpose**: Each room has a distinct role—guarded entry, treasure, lore, or mystery—providing a balanced experience of combat, exploration, and storytelling.

- **Discovery**: The Hidden Chamber adds an element of surprise, rewarding players who pay attention to environmental clues in the Main Hall.

- **Realism**: The rooms are logically arranged with the Guard Room protecting the Treasure Vault and the Main Hall serving as a central junction, providing a believable architectural structure.

- **Vertical Space**: Though not utilized in this layout, vertical space could be integrated in future expansions or deeper dungeon levels, using staircases or ladders to add complexity.
