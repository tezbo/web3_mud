   - **Design Notes**: Acts as a narrative element, emphasizing the dark nature of the setting. The vertical exit adds depth and a hidden path.

### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Flow**: The Entrance Hall serves as the central hub, from where players can choose to explore different paths. The Guard Room and Cell Block provide thematic consistency for a dungeon.
- **Exploration and Discovery**: Hidden Vault as a vertical exploration reward, Torture Chamber's verticality creates a multi-layered experience.
- **Pacing**: The layout encourages players to revisit rooms like the Entrance Hall and Cell Block, maintaining engagement and encouraging exploration.
- **Realism**: The placement of the Guard Room and Armory near the entrance provides a logical defense layout. The Hidden Vault as a secret area adds to the lore and realism of a dungeon setting.

This design balances exploration with storytelling, providing players with a compelling environment to explore in the Shadowfen style.

### Design Notes

- **Flow and Purpose**: The map design encourages players to navigate through the Main Chamber, which serves as the central hub, ensuring they encounter multiple paths and decisions. The design also guides players naturally from the Entrance to key areas like the Cells and Guard Chamber, while the Hidden Passage and Treasure Room offer an optional, rewarding exploration path.
  
- **Exploration and Discovery**: The Hidden Passage and the down exit from the Cells room encourage players to explore and discover secrets, providing optional challenges and rewards.
  
- **Pacing and Realism**: The dungeon's layout is compact but non-linear, providing a sense of depth and complexity without overwhelming the player. The spatial logic is consistent with a dungeon setting, emphasizing security (Guard Chamber) and mystery (Hidden Passage).

- **Vertical Space**: Although the map is primarily horizontal, the Entrance and Cells incorporate vertical elements, enhancing the dungeon's dimensionality and realism.
