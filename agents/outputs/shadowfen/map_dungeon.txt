### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Flow**: The design uses the Main Hall as a central hub, which is typical for Shadowfen's architectural style, emphasizing a sense of mystery and interconnectedness. Players are encouraged to explore multiple routes from this central point.
- **Exploration**: Hidden Passage offers a sense of discovery, rewarding players who take the time to explore off the beaten path.
- **Realism**: The layout makes sense for a dungeon setting, with the Entryway leading naturally into the Main Hall. The Armory is placed logically near the Main Hall for easy access to supplies.
- **Purpose**: The design encourages both linear progression (from Entryway to Treasury) and lateral exploration (Hidden Passage and Armory), balancing exploration with convenience.
- **Pacing**: The rooms are clustered around the central Main Hall, creating a sense of progression as players navigate deeper into the dungeon towards the Treasury.
