### Design Notes

- **Central Hub**: The Chamber of Echoes serves as the main navigational point, offering multiple directions to explore other rooms.
- **Flow**: The dungeon encourages exploration with its branching paths from the central hub. Each room has a distinct purpose, rewarding players who seek out every corner.
- **Discovery**: The Crypt and the Ancient Armory hold secrets that can alter the player’s path through the dungeon, rewarding those who investigate thoroughly.
- **Pacing**: The Sacrificial Altar acts as a midway point between exploration-heavy areas (Fungal Grotto, Darkened Library) and the more combat-oriented Ancient Armory.
- **Realism**: The layout reflects a forgotten, ritualistic site with logical room placements, such as the library being a place for knowledge adjacent to the altar.
- **Vertical Space**: Subtle vertical elements are implied through the crypt's descent and the armory's mechanism, adding depth to exploration.
