Here's the design for a 6-room district called 'Dungeon' in Shadowfen style:

```
          [5] Guard Post
            /   \
          /       \
[1] Entrance - [2] Main Hall - [3] Torture Chamber
          |       |
          |       |
        [6] Prison Cells
            |
        [4] Secret Passage
```

**Room List with Exits:**

1. **Entrance**
   - Exits: East to Main Hall, South to Secret Passage
   - Purpose: The entry point of the dungeon; a narrow, damp corridor with flickering torchlight. Sets the stage for the oppressive atmosphere.

2. **Main Hall**
   - Exits: West to Entrance, East to Torture Chamber, South to Prison Cells
   - Purpose: Central hub of the dungeon; a large, echoing chamber with a high ceiling. It serves as the intersection for major paths, allowing flow to key areas.

3. **Torture Chamber**
   - Exits: West to Main Hall
   - Purpose: A grim room filled with sinister devices. Acts as a dead-end for those who explore, reinforcing the dungeon's dark theme and rewarding players with narrative elements and loot.

4. **Secret Passage**
   - Exits: North to Entrance
   - Purpose: A hidden, narrow corridor that provides a shortcut back to the Entrance. This passage rewards observant players with a quicker route and potential hidden treasures.

5. **Guard Post**
   - Exits: South to Main Hall, East to Prison Cells
   - Purpose: A small room overlooking the Main Hall, used by guards to monitor movement. Adds vertical complexity as it might be on a slightly raised platform.

6. **Prison Cells**
   - Exits: North to Main Hall, West to Guard Post
   - Purpose: A row of iron-barred cells for prisoners. Players might find useful items or story elements here, enhancing the exploration aspect.

**Design Notes:**

- **Flow and Navigation:** The Main Hall acts as the central hub, ensuring players can easily navigate to key areas without getting lost. The placement of the Guard Post and Torture Chamber emphasizes the oppressive nature of the dungeon.

- **Exploration and Discovery:** The Secret Passage provides an element of surprise and rewards players who pay attention to their surroundings. The Prison Cells offer narrative depth, potentially tied to quests or character stories.

- **Realism and Atmosphere:** The spatial design reinforces the theme of a foreboding dungeon. Each room has a logical purpose and contributes to the overall mood of decay and danger.

- **Layered Complexity:** The Guard Post and Secret Passage utilize vertical and hidden elements to enrich player experience, adding depth and encouraging thorough exploration.
