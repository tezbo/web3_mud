### Design Notes

- **Flow:** The map ensures a natural progression from the Entrance to deeper, more dangerous areas. The Antechamber acts as a central hub, facilitating exploration without feeling linear.
  
- **Purpose:** Each room serves a distinct role, from the utilitarian Armory to the mysterious Chamber of Secrets, providing opportunities for storytelling and player interaction.
  
- **Discovery:** The Chamber of Secrets is a reward for thorough exploration, encouraging players to search beyond the obvious.
  
- **Pacing:** The transition from the mundane (Antechamber, Guardroom) to the mystical (Crypt) gradually increases tension and stakes.

- **Realism:** The layout makes sense for a defensive structure, with logical room placements and connections reflecting its historical use.

This design balances exploration and narrative while maintaining an engaging player experience.
