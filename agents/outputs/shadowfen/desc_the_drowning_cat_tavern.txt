The Drowning Cat Tavern huddles beneath a canopy of whispering willows, their long tendrils brushing the thatched roof with a ghostly caress. Within, the air is heavy with the scent of damp wood and peat smoke, mingling with the sharp bite of fermented moss ale. Shadows cling to the corners, their edges softened by the flickering glow of lanterns swaying gently from rusted chains. The floorboards creak underfoot, each step releasing a faint echo that mingles with the murmur of low voices and the occasional clink of ceramic mugs. A chill drafts through the room, carrying the distant croak of marsh frogs, leaving a cool, lingering touch upon the skin.
