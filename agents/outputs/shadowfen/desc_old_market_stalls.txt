In the heart of Shadowfen's Old Market Stalls, the air is thick with the scent of damp earth and rust, mingling with the sweet decay of overripe fruit. Tattered awnings flutter like moth wings above tables burdened with tarnished trinkets and shadowy curiosities. The muted clatter of vendors’ whispered haggling fills the air, punctuated by the soft squelch of the muddy ground underfoot. A chill breeze snakes through the narrow aisles, carrying with it a faint, metallic taste that clings to the back of your throat.
