### Room List with Exits

1. **Shanty Alley**
   - **Exits:** South to Makeshift Market, East to Crowded Tenement
   - **Description:** The narrow, winding alley serves as the main entry point into the slums. Its uneven cobblestones and haphazardly constructed shanties set the tone for the area. The alley is often bustling with residents and stray animals.
   - **Purpose:** Acts as the central hub for the slums, leading to both the market and living quarters.

2. **Crowded Tenement**
   - **Exits:** West to Shanty Alley, South to Hidden Nook
   - **Description:** This dilapidated building houses multiple families in cramped conditions. The air is thick with the scent of cooking fires and the murmur of conversations. A rickety staircase leads up to a makeshift loft.
   - **Purpose:** Provides a glimpse into the daily life of the slum's residents, offering potential side quests or interactions with NPCs.

3. **Makeshift Market**
   - **Exits:** North to Shanty Alley, East to Hidden Nook
   - **Description:** A chaotic assembly of stalls and tarps where residents barter goods and services. The market is the heart of the slums' economy, with a vibrant atmosphere despite its rundown appearance.
   - **Purpose:** A place for players to trade items, gather information, or encounter unique vendors with rare goods.

4. **Hidden Nook**
   - **Exits:** North to Crowded Tenement, West to Makeshift Market
   - **Description:** A secluded corner of the slums, accessible only through a narrow gap between buildings. It serves as a refuge for those seeking solitude or conducting discreet meetings away from prying eyes.
   - **Purpose:** Rewards exploration with hidden content, such as secretive NPCs, quests, or lore about the slums' underbelly.

### Design Notes on Flow and Purpose

- **Flow:** Shanty Alley is the central hub, ensuring that players first experience the bustling life of the slums. The design encourages exploration by providing multiple paths to different rooms, with the Hidden Nook serving as a reward for those who venture beyond the obvious routes.
  
- **Discovery:** The Hidden Nook offers a sense of mystery and rewards players who take the time to explore the less-traveled paths. This hidden area provides depth to the slums, suggesting a rich history and unseen layers of society.

- **Pacing:** The layout clusters the market and residential areas close enough to support a sense of community while maintaining distinct spaces for commerce and living. The Hidden Nook is slightly removed, offering a break from the busy atmosphere.

- **Realism:** The disorganized nature of the slums reflects their hasty construction and lack of planning, providing a realistic portrayal of a marginalized community within the game world.

- **Vertical Space:** While not explicitly used in this design, the Crowded Tenement's loft introduces a vertical element that hints at further complexity without overcomplicating the initial exploration of the area.
