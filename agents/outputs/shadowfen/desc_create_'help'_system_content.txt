The air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and the faint, bitter aroma of decaying leaves, a testament to the endless twilight of Shadowfen. Shadows dance across the stone walls, their surfaces slick with a thin sheen of moisture that leaves a chill lingering on the skin. The soft rustle of unseen creatures echoes through the gloom, a constant reminder of the marshland's teeming life. Faintly, the taste of iron tangs the air, as if the room itself exhaled the breath of forgotten times. Lanterns of tarnished bronze cast an eerie, flickering light, illuminating the intricate patterns etched into the floor, whispering secrets of ancient rites and lost magics.
