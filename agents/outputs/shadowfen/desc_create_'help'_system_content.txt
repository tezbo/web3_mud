A jagged moon slinks through the tangle of branches above, casting ghostly patterns across the damp, earthen floor. The air is a musky tapestry of decaying leaves and rich, loamy soil, tinged with the faint, metallic bite of rust from ancient, forgotten relics half-buried in the muck. A low, persistent murmur of water threads through the silence, its source unseen, yet omnipresent, echoing like whispered secrets among the trees. The cool mist clings to your skin, a shiver-inducing caress that blurs the edges of the world, leaving you ensnared in Shadowfen's enigmatic embrace.
