In the heart of Shadowfen, a chamber of whispered secrets breathes with the murmur of unseen waters. Shadows pool like living ink beneath the ancient stone archways, where the scent of damp earth mingles with the metallic tang of rust. A chill permeates the air, brushing against the skin like the fleeting touch of a long-forgotten memory, while the distant croak of frogs adds an eerie symphony to the silence. Flickering torchlight dances across the walls, revealing cryptic runes etched deeply into the stone, their purpose obscured in the half-light.
