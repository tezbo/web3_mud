The murky light of the Shadowfen seeps through cracks in the warped wooden ceiling, casting distorted shadows that writhe across the walls like restless spirits. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the sharp tang of rust, mingling with a faint, sweet decay that clings to the throat. A faint, persistent drip echoes from somewhere unseen, each drop a distant heartbeat in the oppressive stillness. The floor beneath your feet feels slick and treacherous, a patchwork of damp stone and creeping moss that threatens to swallow your very step.
