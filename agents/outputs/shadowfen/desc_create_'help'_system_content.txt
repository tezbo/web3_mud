In the heart of Shadowfen, the chamber breathes with an eerie, spectral life. Wisps of mist slither through the cracked stone floor, coiling around rust-veined pillars that seem to hum with a low, unsettling resonance. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint, acrid bite of decay, clinging to the skin like a cold, clammy shroud. Faded tapestries hang in tattered whispers against the walls, their once-vibrant silks now a muted testament to forgotten tales, while the distant drip of water echoes through the gloom, a steady reminder of time's relentless passage.
