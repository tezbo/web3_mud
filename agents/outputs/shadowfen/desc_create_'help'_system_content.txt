The chamber is shrouded in perpetual twilight, where the air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and ancient decay. Soft, almost imperceptible whispers echo off the rusted iron walls, like the sighs of long-forgotten spirits. A thin veil of mist clings to the uneven stone floor, cool and clammy against the skin, seeping through the soles of your boots. Flickers of ghostly blue light dance across the surfaces, casting fleeting shadows that twist and writhe like living things.
