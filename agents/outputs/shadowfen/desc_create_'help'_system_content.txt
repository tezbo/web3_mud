In the heart of Shadowfen, the room is cloaked in a persistent, eerie twilight, where tendrils of mist curl lazily around tarnished iron shelves, their surfaces slick with a constant bead of moisture. The air is thick with the earthy scent of damp soil and decaying leaves, intermingled with an acrid hint of mildew. A soft, unsettling drip echoes from somewhere unseen, punctuating the oppressive silence like a distant heartbeat. As you brush against the walls, the cold, clammy stone clings to your skin, leaving a lingering chill that seeps into your bones.
