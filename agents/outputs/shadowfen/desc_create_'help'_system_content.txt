In the dimly lit chamber, the air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a testament to Shadowfen’s eternal twilight. Shadows dance across the rusted iron walls, their flickering forms conjured by the erratic glow of a lone, sputtering lantern. The soft squelch of moss underfoot and the distant drip of water echo like whispered secrets through the cavernous space. Each breath feels cool and clammy, leaving a metallic aftertaste as if the very atmosphere is imbued with ancient, forgotten magics.
