In the heart of Shadowfen, a chamber looms, wreathed in perpetual twilight. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a testament to the encroaching swamp. Faint echoes of dripping water punctuate the silence, as if the walls themselves weep. A cold mist clings to your skin, leaving a slick residue that shivers with every brush of your fingers. Rusted iron sconces line the walls, their feeble glow casting eerie shadows that dance like specters on the slick stone floor.
