In the dim glow of phosphorescent fungi, the chamber unfurls like a forgotten secret, cloaked in a perpetual shroud of mist. The air is thick with the pungent aroma of damp earth and the sharp, metallic scent of slowly rusting iron, whispering of ages past. A faint, rhythmic drip echoes from somewhere unseen, each drop resonating through the veil of shadows like a distant heartbeat. As you brush against the slick stone walls, a chill seeps into your skin, leaving a lingering trace of the fen's eerie embrace.
