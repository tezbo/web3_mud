Within the heart of Shadowfen, a dimly lit chamber sprawls, its stone walls slick with perpetual dampness, reflecting the pale glow of phosphorescent fungi. The air hangs heavy with the earthy scent of moss and the faint metallic bite of rust, mingling with the distant croak of unseen creatures. Underfoot, the ground is soft and yielding, a carpet of loamy soil and decaying leaves that squelches softly with each step. A chill pervades the air, prickling at exposed skin like the whisper of a forgotten curse, while tendrils of mist curl lazily around your ankles, as if welcoming you into their embrace.
