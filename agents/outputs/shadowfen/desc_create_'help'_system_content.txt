In the heart of Shadowfen, the chamber is cloaked in a swirling mist that clings to the skin like a cool, damp veil. The air is thick with the earthy scent of moss and the sharpness of rust, both mingling with the faint, metallic echo of dripping water. Shadows writhe across the walls, their dance orchestrated by the flickering of lanterns hung from chains, casting eerie, fragmented light on the slick stone floor. Each step sends a shiver up the spine as the ground yields slightly, the texture a curious blend of smooth slate and gritty residue. The silence is punctuated only by the distant croak of unseen creatures, a reminder of the wilds lurking just beyond the walls.
