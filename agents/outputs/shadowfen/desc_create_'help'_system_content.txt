Thick, clinging mist coils around the chamber, its chill seeping through threadbare cloaks and settling into bones like an old, familiar ache. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and rust, an acrid undertone that catches at the back of the throat. Faint echoes of dripping water punctuate the silence, each drop a hollow note that reverberates through the gloom. Shadows slink along the jagged stone walls, their edges blurred and shifting, as if the room itself breathes in time with some unseen, ancient rhythm.
