A languid mist clings to the shadowy alcove, where ancient tomes are stacked like forgotten whispers. The air is thick with the earthy scent of damp wood and the faint, metallic tang of rusted chains that sway gently from the rafters. A low hum resonates through the stone walls, akin to a distant, mournful chant, sending shivers along your spine. Cold, slick flagstones beneath your feet seem to pulse with a life of their own, as if the very floor remembers the passage of time.
