The room is swathed in perpetual twilight, where faint, spectral light filters through the tangled lattice of branches overhead. The air is heavy with the earthy scent of damp moss and the metallic bite of nearby rusting iron. A soft, persistent drip echoes from unseen corners, each drop a whisper against the slick flagstones underfoot. Shadows flit across the walls, fluid as ink, and the chill of the air clings like a second skin, leaving a ghostly touch in its wake.
