The chamber looms with an oppressive, ink-black mist that clings to the stone walls like an ancient curse. Faint echoes of distant whispers slither through the air, their source unseen, leaving a tingling chill that creeps along the skin. The air is thick with the pungent, earthy scent of decaying leaves, mingling with the faint iron tang of rust from the corroded iron chains draped across the room. Underfoot, the floor is slick with moisture, each step a cautious venture as your boots slip against the moss-covered flagstones.
