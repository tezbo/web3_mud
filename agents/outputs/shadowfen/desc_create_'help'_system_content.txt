A shroud of mist clings to the rough-hewn walls of the chamber, casting everything in a muted gray haze. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint, acrid bite of rust, a testament to the forgotten relics strewn across the stone floor. Water drips from the ceiling in a slow, rhythmic cadence, each drop echoing through the cavernous space like a distant heartbeat. As your fingers brush against the cold, slick surface of a crumbling pillar, a shiver runs down your spine, as if the shadows themselves are watching, waiting.
