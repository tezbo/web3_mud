The chamber is shrouded in a perpetual, swirling mist that clings to the skin like a damp shroud, its chill seeping through even the thickest of cloaks. The soft rustle of unseen creatures echoes through the gloom, their movements stirring the dense fog in spectral patterns. A faint, acrid tang of decaying leaves and wet earth permeates the air, mingling with the sharper, metallic scent of rust. The stone walls, slick with moisture, glisten in the dim light filtering through a cracked, iron-bound window, casting ghostly reflections that dance along the floor.
