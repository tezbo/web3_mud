The chamber lies shrouded in a perpetual twilight, where tendrils of mist twist languidly around ancient, rust-streaked columns. A faint, incessant dripping echoes through the room, each drop striking the stone floor with a hollow resonance that seems to seep into your bones. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a cloying perfume that clings to your skin like a second layer. Shadows dance across the walls, their movements eerily synchronized with the flickering light from a single, guttering lantern, casting an ever-shifting tapestry of ominous shapes.
