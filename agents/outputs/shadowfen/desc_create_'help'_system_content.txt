The chamber is shrouded in a whispering veil of mist, each tendril curling and weaving through the heavy air like a living tapestry. Faint echoes of distant drips punctuate the silence, a rhythmic heartbeat in the gloom. Rusted chains dangle from the ceiling, cold to the touch, their metallic scent mingling with the earthy aroma of damp stone and decaying leaves. Shadows dance and flicker across the walls, teasing the eye with shapes that shift and vanish just as quickly as they've come.
