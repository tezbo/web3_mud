The room is a dim sanctuary where shadows cling to the walls like ancient moss. A damp chill permeates the air, carrying the earthy scent of wet leaves and the faintest whisper of decay. Flickering lanterns cast an amber glow over rusted iron shelves, their surfaces pocked and cold to the touch. The distant croak of unseen frogs echoes softly, a lullaby to the whispering breeze that rustles through tattered curtains. Here, the atmosphere feels both oppressive and intimate, as if the room itself holds secrets whispered by the mist.
