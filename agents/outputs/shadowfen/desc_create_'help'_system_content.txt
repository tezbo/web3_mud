In the heart of Shadowfen, the chamber is cloaked in a perpetual twilight, where tattered tapestries of deep emerald and rust hang like forgotten whispers. The air is thick, heavy with the damp scent of moss and the faint, acrid bite of mildew. A low, eerie hum resonates from the stone walls, echoing like distant voices trapped within the layers of the marsh. As you brush against the slick surface of an ancient, carved obsidian table, a chill seeps into your fingertips, leaving an unsettling, icy tingle. Shadows slither around the flickering light of a single oil lamp, casting distorted shapes that dance and writhe across the room's edges.
