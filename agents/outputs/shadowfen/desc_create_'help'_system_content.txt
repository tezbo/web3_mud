In the heart of Shadowfen, the chamber unfolds like a murmur in the mist, its walls draped in a tapestry of creeping ivy and rust-streaked stone. The air tastes of damp earth and decaying leaves, a musty aroma that clings to the skin like an unwelcome shroud. The only sound is the soft drip of water echoing from unseen crevices, a mournful rhythm that underscores the oppressive silence. Underfoot, the moss-covered floor yields with a spongy give, each step a whispered secret in the dim, green-tinged light filtering through the mist.
