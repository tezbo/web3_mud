The chamber lies shrouded in a perpetual twilight, where the air is thick with the acrid scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. Stalactites hang like jagged teeth from the ceiling, dripping icy water that echoes through the gloom with a slow, rhythmic plink. Along the walls, veins of rust-colored ore seem to pulse with an eerie, dull glow, casting flickering shadows that dance like specters across the slick stone floor. A chill seeps through your boots, numbing toes and sending shivers up your spine, while the distant hoot of a fen owl punctuates the quiet with haunting regularity.
