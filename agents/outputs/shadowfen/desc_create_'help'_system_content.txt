The room is a whispering cavern where the air hangs heavy with the musk of damp earth and ancient, decaying leaves. Shadows coil around stalagmites, their surfaces slick and cold to the touch, like the scales of a serpent lurking just beneath the surface. A soft, rhythmic drip echoes from the depths, each drop splashing into unseen pools with a hushed reverence. The scent of rusted iron lingers, mingling with the faint sweetness of overripe fruit, creating an unsettling harmony that clings to your senses. Pale, phosphorescent fungi cast an eerie glow, their light flickering like distant stars obscured by a fog-bound sky.
