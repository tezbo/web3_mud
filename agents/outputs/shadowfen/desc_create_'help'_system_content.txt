In the dim heart of Shadowfen, a library of forgotten knowledge unfurls beneath a canopy of twisting, gnarled branches. The air is thick with the musty aroma of ancient tomes, their pages whispering secrets as they flutter in the draft sweeping through cracked, moss-covered windows. Flickering lanterns cast a pallid glow, their light struggling against the encroaching shadows that cling to the stone walls like persistent memories. The only sound is the soft drip of water echoing from somewhere above, each drop a cold kiss against the skin, a reminder of the damp chill that permeates the room.
