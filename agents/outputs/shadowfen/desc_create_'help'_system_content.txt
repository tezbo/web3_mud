The air is thick with an earthy dampness, carrying whispers of moss and decay that cling to the skin like a cold shroud. Flickering lanterns cast ghostly reflections upon the walls, their light struggling to pierce the swirling mist that dances in the corners. The floor, slick with a sheen of moisture, groans softly beneath each cautious step, echoing the distant croak of unseen frogs. A faint metallic tang lingers in the air, reminiscent of rusted iron left to the mercy of the swamp's embrace.
