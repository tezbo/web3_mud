The room is shrouded in a murky twilight, where thick tendrils of mist cling to the cracked stone walls, giving the air a damp, earthy scent. A faint dripping echoes from somewhere unseen, punctuating the silence with a hollow, rhythmic cadence. Cold moisture slicks the uneven floor beneath your feet, its chill seeping through your boots like icy fingers. Shadows flicker across a rusted iron brazier, casting wavering specters that dance and dissolve into the gloom, leaving only a lingering taste of mildew on the tongue.
