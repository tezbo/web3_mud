The chamber lies shrouded in a perpetual haze, where tendrils of mist weave through rusted iron beams, whispering secrets to the shadows. A faint drip echoes from the vaulted ceiling, its rhythm a haunting lullaby that melds with the distant croak of unseen creatures. The air hangs heavy with the scent of wet earth and the acrid bite of decaying foliage, clinging to skin like a clammy shroud. Underfoot, the floor is slick with moss, each step a tentative dance on the slick stones that seem to pulse with the very essence of the swamp.
