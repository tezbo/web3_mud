The room is shrouded in a dense, swirling mist that clings to the skin like a damp shroud, carrying the earthy musk of decaying leaves and the faint tang of rust. Ghostly tendrils of fog weave through the air, casting everything in a muted, spectral light that plays tricks on the eyes, making shadows dance and shift. The sound of distant dripping echoes through the space, a rhythmic patter like the heartbeat of the fen itself, while underfoot, the floor is slick and uneven, each step sinking slightly into the spongy, moss-covered ground. A chill hangs in the air, sharp and biting, as if the room itself is whispering secrets meant only for those who dare to listen.
