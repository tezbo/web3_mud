The chamber yawns open like a cavernous maw, its walls slick with a sheen of eternal dampness that glistens in the half-light. A chorus of distant drips echoes from the stalactites above, their rhythm a ghostly accompaniment to the stifling silence. The air hangs heavy with the earthy scent of decaying leaves and the faint, acrid tang of rust, as if the very stones are slowly corroding. Touching the walls, one feels the clammy chill seep into the skin, leaving a lingering sensation of something ancient and forgotten.
