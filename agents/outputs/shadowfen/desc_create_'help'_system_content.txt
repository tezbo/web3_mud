In the heart of Shadowfen, the room is shrouded in swirling mists that cling to the skin like cold, damp velvet. Shadows play tricks on the eyes, dancing across walls streaked with rust and the ghostly outlines of forgotten scripts. The faint drip of moisture echoes in the gloom, accompanied by the earthy, metallic scent of decay that permeates the air. Underfoot, the floor feels uneven and slick, as if the very stones have absorbed centuries of secrets and sorrow.
