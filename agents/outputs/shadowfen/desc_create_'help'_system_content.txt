The chamber is a murky warren of shadows, where the walls weep with the slow drip of moisture, their surface slick and cool to the touch. Wisps of mist coil languidly at your feet, whispering secrets of the fen with every languid swirl. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and the faint, acrid tang of rusted iron, pricking at your senses. From a distant corner, the soft plink of water echoes, a rhythmic lullaby that mingles with the rustle of unseen creatures skittering across the stone floor.
