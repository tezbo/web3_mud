The chamber is shrouded in a perpetual twilight, where wisps of mist coil lazily around ancient, rust-streaked iron pillars. A damp chill caresses the skin, carrying the earthy scent of moss and decaying leaves, mingled with the faint acrid tang of distant bog fires. The air hums softly with the whispers of unseen creatures, their voices echoing from the shadowed recesses of the room. Underfoot, the floor is uneven, slick with a film of moisture that clings to the soles, lending a treacherous quality to each step.
