The chamber is steeped in shadows, where the air seems to quiver with ancient whispers that slither through the damp, stone walls.

Flickering torchlight dances upon rusted iron sconces, casting elongated, spectral figures that shift and sway like restless spirits. The distant drip of water echoes softly, each droplet a ghostly reminder of time's relentless passage in this forgotten hollow.
