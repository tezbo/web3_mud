The chamber is a tapestry of shadows, where the walls weep with rivulets of rust, painting dark streaks on the decaying stone. A low, persistent drip echoes against the silence, each drop a resonant note in the symphony of solitude. The air hangs heavy with the scent of wet earth and the faint, acrid tang of iron, clinging to the skin like a damp shroud. Beneath your feet, the floor is slick with a thin film of algae, each step a cautious negotiation with the treacherous terrain.
