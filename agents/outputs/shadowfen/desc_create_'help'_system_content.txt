In the heart of Shadowfen, the air is thick with a damp, earthy musk, clinging to the skin like a cold, wet cloak. Pale beams of moonlight filter through the tangled canopy above, casting a ghostly lattice of shadows across the rust-streaked walls of the ancient chamber. A faint, persistent drip echoes in the silence, each droplet falling into an unseen pool with a hollow plunk that reverberates through the mist. The stone floor is slick beneath your boots, slick with a film of moss and moisture that makes every step a careful dance against the threat of slipping into the murky depths below.
