The room is a dim alcove, where damp stone walls glisten with the moisture of perpetual mist, casting ghostly reflections in the flickering light of a guttering, rusted lantern. A thick, acrid scent of mildew and wet earth hangs heavily in the air, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of ancient iron. The floor is uneven, slick with patches of moss that squelch softly underfoot, offering treacherous footing. From the depths of shadowed corners, the distant drip of water echoes, a rhythmic reminder of the encroaching marsh outside.
