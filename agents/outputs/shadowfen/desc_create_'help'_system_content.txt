Within the heart of Shadowfen, a narrow chamber choked with mist awaits, its air thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint, acrid bite of rust. The walls, slick with condensation, glisten in the dim light filtering through gaps in the rotting wooden ceiling, casting shadows that dance like phantoms. A distant drip echoes through the gloom, each drop a rhythmic reminder of the world's slow decay. Underfoot, the floor is uneven, the flagstones slick and cold, as if the very stones themselves weep for the sunless swamp that sprawls beyond.
