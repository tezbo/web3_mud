In the heart of Shadowfen, the room is cloaked in a perpetual, swirling mist that dances along the uneven stone floor. The damp air clings to your skin, laced with the earthy musk of moss and the faint, acrid bite of rusting iron. Shadows writhe along the jagged walls, their fluid motions accompanied by the soft whisper of distant, unseen water. A solitary lantern, its light flickering through a haze of cobwebs, casts an eerie glow, revealing ancient carvings etched deep into the stone, each groove filled with the scent of wet earth and decay.
