The air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, wrapping around you like a sodden cloak. Mist coils languidly around ironwood beams that groan softly under the weight of time and shadow. The gentle drip of moisture from the moss-laden rafters echoes in the dim light, pooling in shallow depressions worn smooth by countless years. Each step on the flagstone floor sends a subtle shiver through your soles, the chill of the stones seeping upwards like the touch of a forgotten ghost.
