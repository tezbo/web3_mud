The chamber is cloaked in a perpetual twilight, where the air hangs heavy with the damp musk of decaying leaves and the faint, acrid bite of rusting metal. Shadows dance across the slick stone walls, their movements accompanied by the distant drip of water echoing through unseen crevices. Underfoot, the ground is a patchwork of cold, uneven flagstones, their surfaces slick with a thin sheen of moisture that clings like a second skin. The only light comes from moss that glows faintly with an eerie, bioluminescent green, casting ghostly patterns that ripple like whispers in the mist-laden air.
