The air hangs thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a testament to the encroaching swamp beyond the shattered stone walls. Shadows waltz across the floor, cast by the flickering light of a lone, sputtering torch that struggles against the oppressive gloom. The soft, persistent drip of water echoes through the chamber, a haunting melody that resonates in the bones and amplifies the cold seeping up from the flagstones. As you run your fingers along the walls, you feel the gritty texture of ancient moss, its presence a reminder of the relentless passage of time and nature's quiet reclamation.
