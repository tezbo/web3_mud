The chamber is a tapestry of shadows, where the air hangs heavy with the musk of damp earth and decaying leaves. Wisps of mist coil languidly around ironwood beams, their rusted surfaces cold and rough to the touch. A distant drip echoes, its rhythm a haunting lullaby in the silence, while the scent of stagnant water mingles with the acrid sting of moss. Flickering lanterns cast a ghostly glow, their light dancing like spectral fingers across walls etched with ancient, indecipherable script.
